# ✅ Question 5: FAME's Macro Flow Analysis

## **Query:**

"If the U.S. 10-year yield spikes 75 bps within a month while M2 velocity declines and the dollar index rises above 110, how should global risk assets and crypto liquidity react across 1-, 7-, and 30-day horizons? Provide reasoning rooted in macro flow dynamics, not price correlation."

---

## **FAME's Analysis:**

### **CAUSAL CHAIN:**

**1. Yield Spike → Liquidity Drain**
- 75bp rise signals monetary tightening, reduces available capital
- Effect: Cost of capital rises, risk-free rate increases

**2. M2 Velocity Decline → Stagflationary Pressure**
- Money hoarded not spent, indicates uncertainty and reduced economic activity
- Effect: Deflationary impulse despite inflation expectations

**3. DXY > 110 → Capital Flight to USD**
- Strong dollar pulls capital from EM and risk assets globally
- Effect: Dollar strength = liquidity drain from non-USD markets

---

### **TEMPORAL ANALYSIS:**

#### **DAY 1:**
**Reaction:** IMMEDIATE SHOCK
- Risk Assets: Sharp sell-off, no differentiation
- Crypto: Correlates with equities, high volatility
- Liquidity: Dries up immediately as shorts cover
- **Reasoning:** Causative: Rate shock = instant risk repricing, all correlations spike to 1.0

---

#### **DAY 7:**
**Reaction:** DIFFERENTIATION PHASE
- Risk Assets: Higher quality separates, junk underperforms
- Crypto: BTC potentially acts as safe haven brief respite, then re-correlation
- Liquidity: Cross-exchange spreads widen, funding rates spike
- **Reasoning:** Causative: Week allows for relative value assessment. BTC flight-to-quality brief before institutional deleveraging overwhelms

---

#### **DAY 30:**
**Reaction:** STRUCTURAL SHIFT
- Risk Assets: Sustained bear market, credit stress visible
- Crypto: Full re-correlation with risk assets, heavy selling pressure
- Liquidity: Chronic liquidity drain, permanent capital flight
- **Reasoning:** Causative: 30 days = policy response window. If Fed doesn't pivot, sustained tightening = structural bear market across all risk assets

**Advanced Notes:**
- Cross-currency funding pressure (EUR-USD basis) amplifies dollar strength
- Repo market stress compounds liquidity drain
- Crypto funding rates sustain positive (traders long) during capitulation

### **KEY INSIGHT:**

> **This is NOT correlation - it's CAUSATIVE flow dynamics.**
> 
> Rising yields → higher cost of capital → deleveraging → liquidity drain → asset selling.
> 
> Crypto reacts first as liquidity proxy, then stabilizes as structural sell-off, then re-correlates as institutional positioning unwinds.
> 
> **Temporal sequence is causal:** Day 1 = shock, Week 1 = flight, Month 1 = structural shift.
