# ✅ Question 5: FAME's REFINED Macro Flow Analysis

## **Query:**

"If the U.S. 10-year yield spikes 75 bps within a month while M2 velocity declines and the dollar index rises above 110, how should global risk assets and crypto liquidity react across 1-, 7-, and 30-day horizons? Provide reasoning rooted in macro flow dynamics, not price correlation."

## **FAME's REFINED Analysis:**

### **KEY INSIGHT:**
> **A 75bp 10-yr shock + falling M2 velocity + USD >110 is a multi-stage liquidity shock. Expect immediate liquidity squeeze and forced deleveraging (1d), propagation through margin cycles and credit repricing (7d), and strategic reallocation or policy-driven stabilization window by 30d. Crypto disproportionately affected as low-liquidity, high-leverage market: heavy initial illiquidity and volatile funding, then sustained reduction in institutional participation unless policy intervenes.**

---

### **CAUSAL CHAIN:**

**1. Yield Spike → Liquidity Drain**
- 75bp rise signals monetary tightening, reduces available capital
- Effect: Cost of capital rises, risk-free rate increases

**2. M2 Velocity Decline → Disinflationary Signal**
- Falling velocity signals weaker real demand (disinflationary pressure). Combined with higher yields raises recession risk. Whether stagflationary depends on inflation persistence channel.
- Effect: Weaker consumption demand, complicates inflation/outlook picture

**3. DXY > 110 → Capital Flight to USD**
- Strong dollar pulls capital from EM and risk assets globally
- Effect: Dollar strength = liquidity drain from non-USD markets

---

### **TEMPORAL ANALYSIS (REFINED):**

#### **DAY 1:**
**Reaction:** IMMEDIATE SHOCK
- Risk Assets: Sharp sell-off, minimal differentiation (HY > IG)
- Crypto: **Outsized volatility and liquidation cascades** as low-liquidity high-leverage market
- Liquidity: **Dealer two-sided quote withdrawal, margin calls begin, repo/FX swap stress**
- **Reasoning:** Causative: Rate shock = instant MTM losses for levered positions. **Cross-asset correlations increase materially as liquidity providers pull back, but dispersion remains across quality.**

---

#### **DAY 7:**
**Reaction:** PROPAGATION / FORCED DELEVERAGING
- Risk Assets: Quality premium emerges (IG vs HY), EM pressures deepen, basis moves in FX swaps
- Crypto: **BTC may temporarily decouple in idiosyncratic moves, but dominant macro flow (USD demand, margin stress) pulls crypto into risk-off**
- Liquidity: **Funding rates volatile with spikes; direction depends on pre-existing positioning.** OTC desks widen, stablecoin redemptions possible
- **Reasoning:** Causative: Margin cycles and systematic rebalances trigger forced selling from leveraged positions. Cross-margin waterfalls and rising CDS spreads.

---

#### **DAY 30:**
**Reaction:** PORTFOLIO REALLOCATION & POLICY FEEDBACK
- Risk Assets: **Two paths: (A) Policy backstop → partial recovery; (B) Growth weakness → continued risk repricing and credit defaults**
- Crypto: Low-liquidity high-vol regime with reduced institutional participation unless policy intervenes
- Liquidity: Strategic reweights (lower risk budgets), central bank communication matters, commercial paper spreads widen
- **Reasoning:** Causative: Corporate cash decisions (M2 velocity matters here). If no backstop, broad risk assets remain lower with credit stress.

**Advanced Notes:**
- Cross-currency funding pressure (EUR-USD basis) amplifies dollar strength
- Repo market stress compounds liquidity drain
- **Funding rate volatility reflects which side is overcrowded - liquidation cascades amplify moves**
