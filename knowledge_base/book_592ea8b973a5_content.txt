List of Illustrations
Chapter 1
Figure 1.1  The three key objectives of cybersecurity programs are
confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
Figure 1.2  Risks exist at the intersection of threats and
vulnerabilities. If either the threat or vulnerability is missing, there is
no risk.
Figure 1.3  The NIST SP 800-30 risk assessment process suggests that
an organization should identify threats and vulnerabilities and then
use that information to determine the level of risk posed by the
combination of those threats and vulnerabilities.
Figure 1.4  Many organizations use a risk matrix to determine an
overall risk rating based on likelihood and impact assessments.
Figure 1.5  In an 802.1x system, the device attempting to join the
network runs a NAC supplicant, which communicates with an
authenticator on the network switch or wireless access point. The
authenticator uses RADIUS to communicate with an authentication
server.
Figure 1.6  A triple-homed firewall connects to three different
networks, typically an internal network, a DMZ, and the Internet.
Figure 1.7  A triple-homed firewall may also be used to isolate internal
network segments of varying trust levels.
Figure 1.8  Group Policy Objects (GPOs) may be used to apply settings
to many different systems at the same time.
Figure 1.9  NIST divides penetration testing into four phases.
Figure 1.10  The attack phase of a penetration test uses a cyclical
process that gains a foothold and then uses it to expand access within
the target organization.

Introduction
CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CSA+) Study Guide  provides accessible
explanations and real-world knowledge about the exam objectives that make
up the Cybersecurity Analyst+ certification. This book will help you to assess
your knowledge before taking the exam, as well as provide a stepping-stone to
further learning in areas where you may want to expand your skillset or
expertise.
Before you tackle the CSA+, you should already be a security practitioner.
CompTIA suggests that test takers have between 3 and 4 years of existing
hands-on information security experience. You should also be familiar with at
least some of the tools and techniques described in this book. You don’t need
to know every tool, but understanding how to approach a new scenario, tool,
or technology that you may not know using existing experience is critical to
passing the CSA+ exam.
   For up-to-the-minute updates covering additions or
modifications to the CompTIA certification exams, as well as additional
study tools, videos, practice questions, and bonus material, be sure to visit
the Sybex website and forum at www.sybex.com.
CompTIA
CompTIA is a nonprofit trade organization that offers certification in a variety
of IT areas, ranging from the skills that a PC support technical needs, which
are covered in the A+ exam, to advanced certifications like the CompTIA
Advanced Security Practitioner, or CASP certification. CompTIA divides its
exams into four different categories based on the skill level required for the
exam and what topics it covers, as shown in the following table:
www.hellodigi.ir

Foundational Professional Specialty Mastery
IT Fundamentals A+
Cloud+ with Virtualization
CSA+
Linux+
Mobility+
Network+
Security+
Project+
Server+CDIA+
CTT+
Cloud Essentials
Healthcare IT TechCASP
CompTIA recommends that practitioners follow a cybersecurity career path as
shown here:
www.hellodigi.ir

As you can see, despite the A+, Network+, and Security+ falling into the
Professional certification category, the Cybersecurity Analyst+ exam is a more
advanced exam, intended for professionals with hands-on experience and who
possess the knowledge covered by the prior exams.
CompTIA certifications are ISO and ANSI accredited, and they are used
throughout multiple industries as a measure of technical skill and knowledge.
In addition, CompTIA certifications, including the Security+ and the CASP,
have been approved by the U.S. government as Information Assuance
baseline certifications and are included in the State Department’s Skills
Incentive Program.
The Cybersecurity Analyst+ Exam
The Cybersecurity Analyst+ exam, which CompTIA refers to as the CSA+, is
designed to be a vendor-neutral certification for cybersecurity, threat, and
vulnerability analysts. The CSA+ certification is designed for security analysts
www.hellodigi.ir

and engineers as well as Security Operations Center (SOC) staff, vulnerability
analysts, and threat intelligence analysts. It focuses on security analytics and
practical use of security tools in real-world scenarios. It covers four major
domains: Threat Management, Vulnerability Management, Cyber Incident
Response, and Security Architecture and Tool Sets. These four areas include a
range of topics, from reconnaissance to incident response and forensics, while
focusing heavily on scenario-based learning.
The CSA+ exam fits between the entry-level Security+ exam and the
CompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner (CASP) certification, providing a
mid-career certification for those who are seeking the next step in their
certification and career path.
The CSA+ exam is conducted in a format that CompTIA calls “performance-
based assessment.” This means that the exam uses hands-on simulations
using actual security tools and scenarios to perform tasks that match those
found in the daily work of a security practitioner. Exam questions may
include multiple types of questions such as multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank,
multiple-response, drag-and-drop, and image-based problems.
CompTIA recommends that test takers have 3–4 years of information
security–related experience before taking this exam. The exam costs $320 in
the United States, with roughly equivalent prices in other locations around
the globe. More details about the CSA+ exam and how to take it can be found
at https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/cybersecurity-analyst.
Study and Exam Preparation Tips
A test preparation book like this cannot teach you every possible security
software package, scenario, or specific technology that may appear on the
exam. Instead, you should focus on whether you are familiar with the type or
category of technology, tool, process, or scenario as you read the book. If you
identify a gap, you may want to find additional tools to help you learn more
about those topics.
CompTIA recommends the use of NetWars-style simulations, penetration
testing and defensive cybersecurity simulations, and incident response
training to prepare for the CSA+.
Additional resources for hands-on exercises include the following:Exploit-Exercises.com provides virtual machines, documentation, and
www.hellodigi.ir

challenges covering a wide range of security issues at https://exploit-
exercises.com/ .
Hacking-Lab provides Capture the Flag (CTF) exercises in a variety of
fields at https://www.hacking-lab.com/index.html .
The OWASP Hacking Lab provides excellent web application–focused
exercises at https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Hacking_Lab.
PentesterLab provides a subscription-based access to penetration testing
exercises at https://www.pentesterlab.com/exercises/.
The InfoSec Institute provides online capture-the-flag activities with
bounties for written explanations of successful hacks at
http://ctf.infosecinstitute.com/.
Since the exam uses scenario-based learning, expect the questions to involve
analysis and thought, rather than relying on simple memorization. As you
might expect, it is impossible to replicate that experience in a book, so the
questions here are intended to help you be confident that you know the topic
well enough to think through hands-on exercises.
Taking the Exam
Once you are fully prepared to take the exam, you can visit the CompTIA
website to purchase your exam voucher:
www.comptiastore.com/Articles.asp?ID=265&category=vouchersCompTIA partners with Pearson VUE’s testing centers, so your next step will
be to locate a testing center near you. In the United States, you can do this
based on your address or your ZIP code, while non-U.S. test takers may find it
easier to enter their city and country. You can search for a test center near
you at the Pearson Vue website, where you will need to navigate to “Find a
test center.”
http://www.pearsonvue.com/comptia/Now that you know where you’d like to take the exam, simply set up a
Pearson VUE testing account and schedule an exam:
https://certification.comptia.org/testing/schedule-exam
On the day of the test, take two forms of identification, and make sure to
show up with plenty of time before the exam starts. Remember that you will
www.hellodigi.ir

not be able to take your notes, electronic devices (including smartphones and
watches), or other materials in with you.
After the Cybersecurity Analyst+ Exam
Once you have taken the exam, you will be notified of your score
immediately, so you’ll know if you passed the test right away. You should
keep track of your score report with your exam registration records and the
email address you used to register for the exam.
Maintaining Your Certification
CompTIA certifications must be renewed on a periodic basis. To renew your
certification, you can either pass the most current version of the exam, earn a
qualifying higher-level CompTIA or industry certification, or complete
sufficient continuing education activities to earn enough continuing
education units (CEUs) to renew it.
CompTIA provides information on renewals via their website at
https://certification.comptia.org/continuing-education/how-to-renewWhen you sign up to renew your certification, you will be asked to agree to
the CE program’s Code of Ethics, to pay a renewal fee, and to submit the
materials required for your chosen renewal method.
A full list of the industry certifications you can use to acquire CEUs toward
renewing the CSA+ can be found at
https://certification.comptia.org/continuing-education/renewothers/renewing-csa
www.hellodigi.ir

What Does This Book Cover?
This book is designed to cover the four domains included in the CSA+:
Chapter 1: Defending Against Cybersecurity Threats  The book starts
by teaching you how to assess cybersecurity threats, as well as how to
evaluate and select controls to keep your networks and systems secure.
Chapter 2: Reconnaissance and Intelligence Gathering  Gathering
information about an organization and its systems is one of the things that
both attackers and defenders do. In this chapter, you will learn how to acquire
intelligence about an organization using popular tools and techniques. You
will also learn how to limit the impact of intelligence gathering performed
against your own organization.
Chapter 3: Designing a Vulnerability Management Program
Managing vulnerabilities helps to keep your systems secure. In this chapter
you will learn how to identify, prioritize, and remediate vulnerabilities using a
well-defined workflow and continuous assessment methodologies.
Chapter 4: Analyzing Vulnerability Scans  Vulnerability reports can
contain huge amounts of data about potential problems with systems. In this
chapter you will learn how to read and analyze a vulnerability scan report,
what CVSS scoring is and what it means, as well as how to choose the
appropriate actions to remediate the issues you have found. Along the way,
you will explore common types of vulnerabilities and their impact on systems
and networks.
Chapter 5: Building an Incident Response Program  This chapter
focuses on building a formal incident response handling program and team.
You will learn the details of each stage of incident handling from preparation,
to detection and analysis, to containment, eradication, and recovery, to the
final post-incident recovery, as well as how to classify incidents and
communicate about them.
Chapter 6: Analyzing Symptoms for Incident Response  Responding
appropriately to an incident requires understanding how incidents occur and
what symptoms may indicate that an event has occurred. To do that, you also
need the right tools and techniques. In this chapter, you will learn about three
major categories of symptoms. First, you will learn about network events,
including malware beaconing, unexpected traffic, and link failures, as well as
network attacks. Next, you will explore host issues, ranging from system
www.hellodigi.ir

resource consumption issues to malware defense and unauthorized changes.
Finally, you will learn about service- and application-related problems.
Chapter 7: Performing Forensic Analysis  Understanding what occurred
on a system, device, or network, either as part of an incident or for other
purposes, frequently involves forensic analysis. In this chapter you will learn
how to build a forensic capability and how the key tools in a forensic toolkit
are used.
Chapter 8: Recovery and Post-Incident Analysis  Once an incident has
occurred and the initial phases of incident response have taken place, you will
need to work on recovering from it. That process involves containing the
incident to ensure no further issues occur and then working on eradicating
malware, rootkits, and other elements of a compromise. Once the incident
has been cleaned up, the recovery stage can start, including reporting and
preparation for future issues.
Chapter 9: Policy and Compliance  Policy provides the foundation of any
cybersecurity program, and building an effective set of policies is critical to a
successful program. In this chapter you will acquire the tools to build a
standards-based set of security policies, standards, and procedures. You will
also learn how to leverage industry best practices by using guidelines and
benchmarks from industry experts.
Chapter 10: Defense-in-Depth Security Architectures  A strong security
architecture requires layered security procedures, technology, and processes
to provide defense in depth, ensuring that a single failure won’t lead to a
failure. In this chapter you will learn how to design a layered security
architecture and how to analyze security designs for flaws, including single
points of failure and gaps.
Chapter 11: Identity and Access Management Security  The identities
that we rely on to authenticate and authorize users, services, and systems are
a critical layer in a defense-in-depth architecture. This chapter explains
identity, authentication, and authorization concepts and systems. You will
learn about the major threats to identity and identity systems as well as how
to use identity as a defensive layer.
Chapter 12: Software Development Security  Creating, testing, and
maintaining secure software, from simple scripts to complex applications, is
critical for security analysts. In this chapter you will learn about the software
development life cycle, including different methodologies, testing and review
www.hellodigi.ir

techniques, and how secure software is created. In addition, you will learn
about industry standards for secure software to provide you with the
foundation you need to help keep applications and services secure.
Chapter 13: Cybersecurity Toolkit  This chapter provides a survey-style
view of the many tools that you may encounter while performing threat and
vulnerability management as well as incident response. We review tools, what
they do, and where to get them.
Practice Exam  Once you have completed your studies, the practice exam
will provide you with a chance to test your knowledge. Use this exam to find
places where you may need to study more or to verify that you are ready to
tackle the exam. We’ll be rooting for you!

Answer to the Assessment Test
1. C. These three TCP ports are associated with SSH (22), HTTPS (443),
and Oracle databases (1521). Other ports mentioned in the potential
answers are SMTP (25), NetBIOS (137–139), MySQL (3306), WINS (1512),
FTP (20 and 21), and MS-SQL (1433/1434).
2. D. Regional Internet registries like ARIN are best queried either via
their websites or using tools like Whois. Nmap is a useful port scanning
utility, traceroute is used for testing the path packets take to a remote
system, and regmon is an outdated Windows Registry tool that has been
supplanted by Process Monitor.
3. A. Honeypots are systems that are designed to look like attractive
targets. When they are attacked, they simulate a compromise, providing
defenders with a chance to see how attackers operate and what tools they
use. DNS sinkholes provide false information to malicious software,
redirecting queries about command and control systems to allow
remediation. Darknets are segments of unused network space that are
monitored to detect traffic—since legitimate traffic should never be aimed
at the darknet, this can be used to detect attacks and other unwanted
traffic. Crackpots are eccentric people—not a system you’ll run into on a
network.
4. D. Redundant systems, particularly when run in multiple locations and
with other protections to ensure uptime, can help provide availability.
5. B. An authenticated, or credentialed, scan provides the most detailed
view of the system. Black-box assessments presume no knowledge of a
system and would not have credentials or an agent to work with on the
system. Internal views typically provide more detail than external views,
but neither provides the same level of detail that credentials can allow.
6. C. When reading the CVSS 3.0 score, AV is the attack vector. Here, N
means network. Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are
listed at the end of the listing, and all three are rated as High in this CVSS
rating.
7. A. When Alice encounters a false positive error in her scans, her first
action should be to verify it. This may involve running a more in-depth
scan like an authenticated scan, but could also involve getting assistance
from system administrators, checking documentation, or other validation
www.hellodigi.ir

actions. Once she is done, she should document the exception so that it is
properly tracked. Implementing a workaround is not necessary for false
positive vulnerabilities, and updating the scanner should be done before
every vulnerability scan. Using an authenticated scan might help but does
not cover all of the possibilities for validation she may need to use.
8. C. The Containment, Eradication, and Recovery phase of an incident
includes steps to limit damage and document what occurred, including
potentially identifying the attacker and tools used for the attack. This
means that information useful to legal actions is most likely to be
gathered during this phase.
9. B. Integrity breaches involve data being modified or deleted. Systems
being taken offline is an availability issue, protected information being
accessed might be classified as a breach of proprietary information, and
sensitive personally identifiable information breaches would typically be
classified as privacy breaches.
10. C. Active monitoring sends traffic like pings to remote devices as part
of the monitoring process. RMON and netflows are both examples of
router-based monitoring, whereas network taps allow passive monitoring.
11. C. Regular traffic from compromised systems to command and control
nodes is known as beaconing. Anomalous pings could describe unexpected
pings, but they are not typically part of botnet behavior, zombie chatter is
a made-up term, and probing is part of scanning behavior in some cases.
12. C. The df command is used to show the amount of free and used disk
space. Each of the other commands can show information about memory
usage in Linux.
13. A. FTK, EnCase, and dd all provide options that support their use for
forensic disk image creation. Since xcopy cannot create a bitwise image of
a drive, it should not be used to create forensic images.
14. D. Slack space is the space left when a file is written. Since the space
may have previously been filled by another file, file fragments are likely to
exist and be recoverable. Unallocated space is space that has not been
partitioned and could contain data, but looking there isn’t part of Shelly’s
task. The reserved space maintained by drives for wear leveling (for SSDs)
or to replace bad blocks (for spinning disks) may contain data, but again,
this was not part of her task.
www.hellodigi.ir

15. B. Sandboxes are used to isolate attackers, malicious code, and other
untrusted applications. They allow defenders to monitor and study
behavior in the sandbox without exposing systems or networks to
potential attacks or compromise.
16. C. The most foolproof means of ensuring that a system does not
remain compromised is to wipe and rebuild it. Without full knowledge of
when the compromise occurred, restoring a backup may not help, and
both antimalware and antivirus software packages cannot always ensure
that no remnant of the compromise remains, particularly if the attacker
created accounts or otherwise made changes that wouldn’t be detected as
malicious software.
17. B. NIST SP 800-88 defines three levels of action of increasing severity:
clear, purge, and destroy. In this case, purging, which uses technical
means to make data infeasible to recover, is appropriate for a high-
security device. Destruction might be preferable, but the reuse element of
the question rules this out. Reinstallation is not an option in the NIST
guidelines, and clearing is less secure.
18. A. The recovery phase does not typically seek to add new privileges.
Validating that only legitimate accounts exist, that the systems are all
logging properly, and that systems have been vulnerability scanned are all
common parts of an incident response recovery phase.
19. B. This statement is most likely to be part of a standard. Policies
contain high-level statements of management intent; standards provide
mandatory requirements for how policies are carried out, including
statements like that provided in the question. A procedure would include
the step-by-step process, and a guideline describes a best practice or
recommendation.
20. D. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) requires
educational institutions to implement security and privacy controls for
student educational records. HIPAA covers security and privacy for
healthcare providers, health insurers, and health information
clearinghouses; GLBA covers financial institutions; and SOX applies to
financial records of publicly traded companies.
21. B. Fire suppression systems are physical controls. Logical controls are
technical controls that enforce confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
Administrative controls are procedural controls, and operational controls
www.hellodigi.ir

are not a type of security control as used in security design.
22. B. Lauren should implement separation of duties in a way that ensures
that Danielle and Alex cannot abuse their rights without a third party
being involved. This will allow review of their actions and should result in
any issues being discovered.
23. A. Kerberos is designed to run on untrusted networks and encrypts
authentication traffic by default. LDAP and RADIUS can be encrypted but
are not necessarily encrypted by default (and LDAP has limitations as an
authentication mechanism). It is recommended that TACACS+ be run
only on isolated administrative networks.
24. D. The Spiral model uses linear development concepts like those used
in Waterfall but repeats four phases through its life cycle: requirements
gathering, design, build, and evaluation.

OBJECTIVES COVERED IN THIS CHAPTER INCLUDE:
Domain 1: Threat Management
✓ 1.3 Given a network-based threat, implement or
recommend the appropriate response and countermeasure.
✓ 1.4 Explain the purpose of practices used to secure a
corporate environment.
 Cybersecurity analysts are responsible for protecting the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and information
systems used by their organizations. Fulfilling this responsibility requires a
commitment to a defense-in-depth approach to information security that uses
multiple, overlapping security controls to achieve each cybersecurity
objective. It also requires that analysts have a strong understanding of the
threat environment facing their organization in order to develop a set of
controls capable of rising to the occasion and answering those threats.
In the first section of this chapter, you will learn how to assess the
cybersecurity threats facing your organization and determine the risk that
they pose to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your operations.
In the sections that follow, you will learn about some of the controls that you
can put in place to secure networks and endpoints and evaluate the
effectiveness of those controls over time.
www.hellodigi.ir

Cybersecurity Objectives
When most people think of cybersecurity, they imagine hackers trying to
break into an organization’s system and steal sensitive information, ranging
from Social Security numbers and credit cards to top-secret military
information. Although protecting sensitive information from unauthorized
disclosure is certainly one element of a cybersecurity program, it is important
to understand that cybersecurity actually has three complementary
objectives, as shown in Figure 1.1.
Figure 1.1  The three key objectives of cybersecurity programs are
confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
Confidentiality ensures that unauthorized individuals are not able to gain
access to sensitive information. Cybersecurity professionals develop and
implement security controls, including firewalls, access control lists, and
encryption, to prevent unauthorized access to information. Attackers may
seek to undermine confidentiality controls to achieve one of their goals: the
unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.
Integrity ensures that there are no unauthorized modifications to information
or systems, either intentionally or unintentionally. Integrity controls, such as
hashing and integrity monitoring solutions, seek to enforce this requirement.
Integrity threats may come from attackers seeking the alteration of
www.hellodigi.ir

information without authorization or nonmalicious sources, such as a power
spike causing the corruption of information.
Availability ensures that information and systems are ready to meet the needs
of legitimate users at the time those users request them. Availability controls,
such as fault tolerance, clustering, and backups, seek to ensure that legitimate
users may gain access as needed. Similar to integrity threats, availability
threats may come either from attackers seeking the disruption of access or
nonmalicious sources, such as a fire destroying a datacenter that contains
valuable information or services.
Cybersecurity analysts often refer to these three goals, known as the CIA
Triad, when performing their work. They often characterize risks, attacks, and
security controls as meeting one or more of the three CIA Triad goals when
describing them.
www.hellodigi.ir

Evaluating Security Risks
Cybersecurity risk analysis is the cornerstone of any information security
program. Analysts must take the time to thoroughly understand their own
technology environments and the external threats that jeopardize their
information security. A well-rounded cybersecurity risk assessment combines
information about internal and external factors to help analysts understand
the threats facing their organization and then design an appropriate set of
controls to meet those threats.
Before diving into the world of risk assessment, we must begin with a
common vocabulary. You must know three important terms to communicate
clearly with other risk analysts: vulnerabilities, threats, and risks.
A vulnerability is a weakness in a device, system, application, or process that
might allow an attack to take place. Vulnerabilities are internal factors that
may be controlled by cybersecurity professionals. For example, a web server
that is running an outdated version of the Apache service may contain a
vulnerability that would allow an attacker to conduct a denial-of-service
(DoS) attack against the websites hosted on that server, jeopardizing their
availability. Cybersecurity professionals within the organization have the
ability to remediate this vulnerability by upgrading the Apache service to the
most recent version that is not susceptible to the DoS attack.
A threat in the world of cybersecurity is an outside force that may exploit a
vulnerability. For example, a hacker who would like to conduct a DoS attack
against a website and knows about an Apache vulnerability poses a clear
cybersecurity threat. Although many threats are malicious in nature, this is
not necessarily the case. For example, an earthquake may also disrupt the
availability of a website by damaging the datacenter containing the web
servers. Earthquakes clearly do not have malicious intent. In most cases,
cybersecurity professionals cannot do much to eliminate a threat. Hackers
will hack and earthquakes will strike whether we like it or not.
A risk is the combination of a threat and a corresponding vulnerability. Both
of these factors must be present before a situation poses a risk to the security
of an organization. For example, if a hacker targets an organization’s web
server with a DoS attack but the server was patched so that it is not
vulnerable to that attack, there is no risk because even though a threat is
present (the hacker), there is no vulnerability. Similarly, a datacenter may be
vulnerable to earthquakes because the walls are not built to withstand the
www.hellodigi.ir

extreme movements present during an earthquake, but it may be located in a
region of the world where earthquakes do not occur. The datacenter may be
vulnerable to earthquakes but there is little to no threat of earthquake in its
location, so there is no risk.
The relationship between risks, threats, and vulnerabilities is an important
one, and it is often represented by this equation:
Risk = Threat × Vulnerability
This is not meant to be a literal equation where you would actually plug in
values. Instead, it is meant to demonstrate the fact that risks exist only when
there is both a threat and a corresponding vulnerability that the threat might
exploit. If either the threat or vulnerability is zero, the risk is also zero. Figure1.2 shows this in another way: risks are the intersection of threats and
vulnerabilities.
Figure 1.2  Risks exist at the intersection of threats and vulnerabilities. If
either the threat or vulnerability is missing, there is no risk.
Organizations should routinely conduct risk assessments to take stock of
their existing risk landscape. The National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) publishes a guide for conducting risk assessments that is
widely used throughout the cybersecurity field as a foundation for risk
assessments. The document, designated NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-
30, suggests the risk assessment process shown in Figure 1.3.
www.hellodigi.ir

Figure 1.3  The NIST SP 800-30 risk assessment process suggests that an
organization should identify threats and vulnerabilities and then use that
information to determine the level of risk posed by the combination of those
threats and vulnerabilities.
Source: NIST SP 800-30
Identify Threats
Organizations begin the risk assessment process by identifying the types of
threats that exist in their threat environment. Although some threats, such as
malware and spam, affect all organizations, other threats are targeted against
specific types of organizations. For example, government-sponsored advanced
persistent threat (APT) attackers typically target government agencies,
military organizations, and companies that operate in related fields. It is
unlikely that an APT attacker would target an elementary school.
NIST identifies four different categories of threats that an organization might
face and should consider in its threat identification process:
www.hellodigi.ir

Adversarial threats are individuals, groups, and organizations that are
attempting to deliberately undermine the security of an organization.
Adversaries may include trusted insiders, competitors, suppliers,
customers, business partners, or even nation-states. When evaluating an
adversarial threat, cybersecurity analysts should consider the capability of
the threat actor to engage in attacks, the intent of the threat actor, and the
likelihood that the threat will target the organization.Accidental threats occur when individuals doing their routine work
mistakenly perform an action that undermines security. For example, a
system administrator might accidentally delete a critical disk volume,
causing a loss of availability. When evaluating an accidental threat,
cybersecurity analysts should consider the possible range of effects that
the threat might have on the organization.Structural threats occur when equipment, software, or environmental
controls fail due to the exhaustion of resources (such as running out of
gas), exceeding their operational capability (such as operating in extreme
heat), or simply failing due to age. Structural threats may come from IT
components (such as storage, servers, and network devices),
environmental controls (such as power and cooling infrastructure), and
software (such as operating systems and applications). When evaluating a
structural threat, cybersecurity analysts should consider the possible
range of effects that the threat might have on the organization.Environmental threats occur when natural or man-made disasters occur
that are outside the control of the organization. These might include fires,
flooding, severe storms, power failures, or widespread
telecommunications disruptions. When evaluating a structural threat,
cybersecurity analysts should consider the possible range of effects that
the threat might have on the organization.
The nature and scope of the threats in each of these categories will vary
depending on the nature of the organization, the composition of its
technology infrastructure, and many other situation-specific circumstances.
That said, it may be helpful to obtain copies of the risk assessments
performed by other, similar, organizations as a starting point for an
organization’s own risk assessment or to use as a quality assessment check
during various stages of the organization’s assessment.
www.hellodigi.ir

The Insider Threat
When performing a threat analysis, cybersecurity professionals must
remember that threats come from both external and internal sources. In
addition to the hackers, natural disasters, and other threats that begin
outside the organization, rouge employees, disgruntled team members,
and incompetent administrators also pose a significant threat to
enterprise cybersecurity. As an organization designs controls, it must
consider both internal and external threats.
   NIST SP 800-30 provides a great deal of additional information to
help organizations conduct risk assessments, including detailed tasks
associated with each of these steps. This information is outside the scope
of the Cybersecurity Analyst+ exam, but organizations preparing to
conduct risk assessments should download and read the entire
publication.
Identify Vulnerabilities
During the threat identification phase of a risk assessment, cybersecurity
analysts focus on the external factors likely to impact an organization’s
security efforts. After completing threat identification, the focus of the
assessment turns inward, identifying the vulnerabilities that those threats
might exploit to compromise an organization’s confidentiality, integrity, or
availability.
Chapters 3 and 4 of this book focus extensively on the identification and
management of vulnerabilities.
Determine Likelihood, Impact, and Risk
After identifying the threats and vulnerabilities facing an organization, risk
assessors next seek out combinations of threat and vulnerability that pose a
risk to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of enterprise information
and systems. This requires assessing both the likelihood that a risk will
materialize and the impact that the risk will have on the organization if it
does occur.
www.hellodigi.ir

When determining the likelihood of a risk occurring, analysts should consider
two factors. First, they should assess the likelihood that the threat source will
initiate the risk. In the case of an adversarial threat source, this is the
likelihood that the adversary will execute an attack against the organization.
In the case of accidental, structural, or environmental threats, it is the
likelihood that the threat will occur. The second factor that contributes is the
likelihood that, if a risk occurs, it will actually have an adverse impact on the
organization, given the state of the organization’s security controls. After
considering each of these criteria, risk assessors assign an overall likelihood
rating. This may use categories, such as “low,” “medium,” and “high,” to
describe the likelihood qualitatively.
Risk assessors evaluate the impact of a risk using a similar rating scale. This
evaluation should assume that a threat actually does take place and cause a
risk to the organization and then attempt to identify the magnitude of the
adverse impact that the risk will have on the organization. When evaluating
this risk, it is helpful to refer to the three objectives of cybersecurity shown in
Figure 1.1, confidentiality, integrity, and availability, and then assess the
impact that the risk would have on each of these objectives.
   The risk assessment process described here, using categories of
“high,” “medium,” and “low,” is an example of a qualitative risk
assessment process. Risk assessments also may use quantitative
techniques that numerically assess the likelihood and impact of risks.
Quantitative risk assessments are beyond the scope of the Cybersecurity
Analyst+ exam but are found on more advanced security exams, including
the CompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner (CASP) and Certified
Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) exams.
After assessing the likelihood and impact of a risk, risk assessors then
combine those two evaluations to determine an overall risk rating. This may
be as simple as using a matrix similar to the one shown in Figure 1.4 that
describes how the organization assigns overall ratings to risks. For example,
an organization might decide that the likelihood of a hacker attack is medium
whereas the impact would be high. Looking this combination up in Figure 1.4reveals that it should be considered a high overall risk. Similarly, if an
organization assesses the likelihood of a flood as medium and the impact as
low, a flood scenario would have an overall risk of low.
www.hellodigi.ir

Figure 1.4  Many organizations use a risk matrix to determine an overall risk
rating based on likelihood and impact assessments.
Reviewing Controls
Cybersecurity professionals use risk management strategies, such as risk
acceptance, risk avoidance, risk mitigation, and risk transference, to reduce
the likelihood and impact of risks identified during risk assessments. The
most common way that organizations manage security risks is to develop sets
of technical and operational security controls that mitigate those risks to
acceptable levels.
Technical controls are systems, devices, software, and settings that work to
enforce confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability requirements. Examples
of technical controls include building a secure network and implementing
endpoint security, two topics discussed later in this chapter. Operational
www.hellodigi.ir

controls are practices and procedures that bolster cybersecurity. Examples of
operational controls include conducting penetration testing and using reverse
engineering to analyze acquired software. These two topics are also discussed
later in this chapter.
www.hellodigi.ir

Building a Secure Network
Many threats to an organization’s cybersecurity exploit vulnerabilities in the
organization’s network to gain initial access to systems and information. To
help mitigate these risks, organizations should focus on building secure
networks that keep attackers at bay. Examples of the controls that an
organization may use to contribute to building a secure network include
network access control (NAC) solutions; network perimeter security controls,
such as firewalls; network segmentation; and the use of deception as a
defensive measure.
Network Access Control
One of the basic security objectives set forth by most organizations is
controlling access to the organization’s network. Network access control
(NAC) solutions help security professionals achieve two cybersecurity
objectives: limiting network access to authorized individuals and ensuring
that systems accessing the organization’s network meet basic security
requirements.
The 802.1x protocol is a common standard used for NAC. When a new device
wishes to gain access to a network, either by connecting to a wireless access
point or plugging into a wired network port, the network challenges that
device to authenticate using the 802.1x protocol. A special piece of software,
known as a supplicant, resides on the device requesting to join the network.
The supplicant communicates with a service known as the authenticator that
runs on either the wireless access point or the network switch. The
authenticator does not have the information necessary to validate the user
itself, so it passes access requests along to an authentication server using the
RADIUS protocol. If the user correctly authenticates and is authorized to
access the network, the switch or access point then joins the user to the
network. If the user does not successfully complete this process, the device is
denied access to the network or may be assigned to a special quarantine
network for remediation. Figure 1.5 shows the devices involved in 802.1x
authentication.
www.hellodigi.ir

Figure 1.5  In an 802.1x system, the device attempting to join the network
runs a NAC supplicant, which communicates with an authenticator on the
network switch or wireless access point. The authenticator uses RADIUS to
communicate with an authentication server.
There are many different NAC solutions available on the market, and they
differ in two major ways:
Agent-Based vs. Agentless  Agent-based solutions, such as 802.1x, require
that the device requesting access to the network run special software
designed to communicate with the NAC service. Agentless approaches to NAC
conduct authentication in the web browser and do not require special
software.
In-Band vs. Out-of-Band  In-band (or inline) NAC solutions use dedicated
appliances that sit in between devices and the resources that they wish to
access. They deny or limit network access to devices that do not pass the NAC
authentication process. The “captive portal” NAC solutions found in hotels
that hijack all web requests until the guest enters a room number are
examples of in-band NAC. Out-of-band NAC solutions, such as 802.1x,
leverage the existing network infrastructure and has network devices
communicate with authentication servers and then reconfigure the network
to grant or deny network access, as needed.
NAC solutions are often used simply to limit access to authorized users based
on those users successfully authenticating, but they may also make network
admission decisions based on other criteria. Some of the criteria used by NAC
solutions include:
Time of Day  Users may be authorized to access the network only during
specific time periods, such as during business hours.
Role  Users may be assigned to particular network segments based on their
role in the organization. For example, a college might assign faculty and staff
www.hellodigi.ir

to an administrative network that may access administrative systems while
assigning students to an academic network that does not allow such access.
Location  Users may be granted or denied access to network resources based
on their physical location. For example, access to the datacenter network may
be limited to systems physically present in the datacenter.
System Health  NAC solutions may use agents running on devices to obtain
configuration information from the device. Devices that fail to meet
minimum security standards, such as having incorrectly configured host
firewalls, outdated virus definitions, or missing patches, may be either
completely denied network access or placed on a special quarantine network
where they are granted only the limited access required to update the
system’s security.
Administrators may create NAC rules that limit access based on any
combination of these characteristics. NAC products provide the flexibility
needed to implement the organization’s specific security requirements for
network admission.
   You’ll sometimes see the acronym NAC expanded to “Network
Admission Control” instead of “network access control.” In both cases,
people are referring to the same general technology. Network Admission
Control is a proprietary name used by Cisco for its network access control
solutions.
Firewalls and Network Perimeter Security
NAC solutions are designed to manage the systems that connect directly to an
organization’s wired or wireless network. They provide excellent protection
against intruders who seek to gain access to the organization’s information
resources by physically accessing a facility and connecting a device to the
physical network. They don’t provide protection against intruders seeking to
gain access over a network connection. That’s where firewalls enter the
picture.
Network firewalls sit at the boundaries between networks and provide
perimeter security. Much like a security guard might control the physical
perimeter of a building, the network firewall controls the electronic
www.hellodigi.ir

perimeter. Firewalls are typically configured in the triple-homed fashion
illustrated in Figure 1.6 . Triple-homed simply means that the firewall
connects to three different networks. The firewall in Figure 1.6  connects to
the Internet, the internal network, and a special network known as the
demilitarized zone (DMZ). Any traffic that wishes to pass from one zone to
another, such as between the Internet and the internal network, must pass
through the firewall.
Figure 1.6  A triple-homed firewall connects to three different networks,
typically an internal network, a DMZ, and the Internet.
The DMZ is a special network zone designed to house systems that receive
connections from the outside world, such as web and email servers. Sound
firewall designs place these systems on an isolated network where, if they
www.hellodigi.ir

become compromised, they pose little threat to the internal network because
connections between the DMZ and the internal network must still pass
through the firewall and are subject to its security policy.
Whenever the firewall receives a connection request, it evaluates it according
to the firewall’s rule base. This rule base is an access control list (ACL) that
identifies the types of traffic permitted to pass through the firewall. The rules
used by the firewall typically specify the source and destination IP addresses
for traffic as well as the destination port corresponding to the authorized
service. A list of common ports appears in Table 1.1. Firewalls follow the
default deny principle, which says that if there is no rule explicitly allowing a
connection, the firewall will deny that connection.

Several categories of firewalls are available on the market today, and they
vary in both price and functionality:
Packet filtering firewalls simply check the characteristics of each packet
against the firewall rules without any additional intelligence. Packet
filtering firewall capabilities are typically found in routers and other
network devices and are very rudimentary firewalls.Stateful inspection firewalls go beyond packet filters and maintain
information about the state of each connection passing through the
firewall. These are the most basic firewalls sold as stand-alone products.
Next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) incorporate even more information
into their decision-making process, including contextual information
about users, applications, and business processes. They are the current
state-of-the-art in network firewall protection and are quite expensive
compared to stateful inspection devices.
Web application firewalls (WAFs) are specialized firewalls designed to
protect against web application attacks, such as SQL injection and cross-
site scripting. WAFs are discussed in more detail in Chapter 13,
“Cybersecurity Toolkit.”
Network Segmentation
Firewalls use a principle known as network segmentation to separate
networks of differing security levels from each other. This principle certainly
applies to the example shown in Figure 1.6, where the internal network, DMZ,
and Internet all have differing security levels. The same principle may be
applied to further segment the internal network into different zones of trust.
For example, imagine an organization that has several hundred employees
and a large datacenter located in its corporate headquarters. The datacenter
may house many sensitive systems, such as database servers that contain
sensitive employee information, business plans, and other critical
information assets. The corporate network may house employees, temporary
contractors, visitors, and other people who aren’t entirely trusted. In this
common example, security professionals would want to segment the
datacenter network so that it is not directly accessible by systems on the
corporate network. This can be accomplished using a firewall, as shown in
Figure 1.7.

Figure 1.7  A triple-homed firewall may also be used to isolate internal
network segments of varying trust levels.
The network shown in Figure 1.7  uses a triple-homed firewall, just as was
used to control the network perimeter with the Internet in Figure 1.6 . The
concept is identical, except in this case the firewall is protecting the perimeter
of the datacenter from the less trusted corporate network.
Notice that the network in Figure 1.7  also contains a DMZ with a server called
the jump box. The purpose of this server is to act as a secure transition point
between the corporate network and the datacenter network, providing a
trusted path between the two zones. System administrators who need to
access the datacenter network should not connect their laptops directly to the
datacenter network but should instead initiate an administrative connection
to the jump box, using secure shell (SSH), the Remote Desktop Protocol
(RDP), or a similar secure remote administration protocol. After successfully
www.hellodigi.ir

authenticating to the jump box, they may then connect from the jump box to
the datacenter network, providing some isolation between their own systems
and the datacenter network. Connections to the jump box should be carefully
controlled and protected with strong multifactor authentication technology.
Jump boxes may also be used to serve as a layer of insulation against systems
that may only be partially trusted. For example, if you have contractors who
bring equipment owned by their employer onto your network or employees
bringing personally-owned devices, you might use a jump box to prevent
those systems from directly connecting to your company’s systems.
Defense through Deception
Cybersecurity professionals may wish to go beyond typical security controls
and engage in active defensive measures that actually lure attackers to
specific targets and seek to monitor their activity in a carefully controlled
environment.
Honeypots are systems designed to appear to attackers as lucrative targets
due to the services they run, vulnerabilities they contain, or sensitive
information that they appear to host. The reality is that honeypots are
designed by cybersecurity experts to falsely appear vulnerable and fool
malicious individuals into attempting an attack against them. When an
attacker tries to compromise a honeypot, the honeypot simulates a successful
attack and then monitors the attacker’s activity to learn more about his or her
intentions. Honeypots may also be used to feed network blacklists, blocking
all inbound activity from any IP address that attacks the honeypot.
DNS sinkholes feed false information to malicious software that works its
way onto the enterprise network. When a compromised system attempts to
obtain information from a DNS server about its command-and-control server,
the DNS server detects the suspicious request and, instead of responding with
the correct answer, responds with the IP address of a sinkhole system
designed to detect and remediate the botnet-infected system.

Secure Endpoint Management
Laptop and desktop computers, tablets, smartphones, and other endpoint
devices are a constant source of security threats on a network. These systems
interact directly with end users and require careful configuration
management to ensure that they remain secure and do not serve as the entry
point for a security vulnerability on enterprise networks. Fortunately, by
taking some simple security precautions, technology professionals can secure
these devices against most attacks.
Hardening System Configurations
Operating systems are extremely complex pieces of software designed to
perform thousands of different functions. The large code bases that make up
modern operating systems are a frequent source of vulnerabilities, as
evidenced by the frequent security patches issued by operating system
vendors.
One of the most important ways that system administrators can protect
endpoints is by hardening their configurations, making them as attack-
resistant as possible. This includes disabling any unnecessary services or
ports on the endpoints to reduce their susceptibility to attack, ensuring that
secure configuration settings exist on devices and centrally controlling device
security settings.
Patch Management
System administrators must maintain current security patch levels on all
operating systems and applications under their care. Once the vendor releases
a security patch, attackers are likely already aware of a vulnerability and may
immediately begin preying on susceptible systems. The longer an
organization waits to apply security patches, the more likely it becomes that
they will fall victim to an attack. That said, enterprises should always test
patches prior to deploying them on production systems and networks.
Fortunately, patch management software makes it easy to centrally distribute
and monitor the patch level of systems throughout the enterprise. For
example, Microsoft’s System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) allows
administrators to quickly view the patch status of enterprise systems and
remediate any systems with missing patches.
www.hellodigi.ir

Compensating Controls
In some cases, security professionals may not be able to implement all of
the desired security controls due to technical, operational, or financial
reasons. For example, an organization may not be able to upgrade the
operating system on retail point-of-sale terminals due to an
incompatibility with the point-of-sale software. In these cases, security
professionals should seek out compensating controls designed to provide
a similar level of security using alternate means. In the point-of-sale
example, administrators might place the point-of-sale terminals on a
segmented, isolated network and use intrusion prevention systems to
monitor network traffic for any attempt to exploit an unpatched
vulnerability and block it from reaching the vulnerable host. This meets
the same objective of protecting the point-of-sale terminal from
compromise and serves as a compensating control.
Group Policies
Group Policies provide administrators with an efficient way to manage
security and other system configuration settings across a large number of
devices. Microsoft’s Group Policy Object (GPO) mechanism allows
administrators to define groups of security settings once and then apply those
settings to either all systems in the enterprise or a group of systems based
upon role.
For example, Figure 1.8 shows a GPO designed to enforce Windows Firewall
settings on sensitive workstations. This GPO is configured to require the use
of Windows Firewall and block all inbound connections.
www.hellodigi.ir

Figure 1.8  Group Policy Objects (GPOs) may be used to apply settings to
many different systems at the same time.
Administrators may use GPOs to control a wide variety of Windows settings
and create different policies that apply to different classes of system.
Endpoint Security Software
Endpoint systems should also run specialized security software designed to
enforce the organization’s security objectives. At a minimum, this should
include antivirus software designed to scan the system for signs of malicious
software that might jeopardize the security of the endpoint. Administrators
may also choose to install host firewall software that serves as a basic firewall
for that individual system, complementing network-based firewall controls or
host intrusion prevention systems (HIPSs) that block suspicious network
activity. Endpoint security software should report its status to a centralized
management system that allows security administrators to monitor the entire
enterprise from a single location.
www.hellodigi.ir

Mandatory Access Controls
In highly secure environments, administrators may opt to implement a
mandatory access control (MAC) approach to security. In a MAC system,
administrators set all security permissions, and end users cannot modify
those permissions. This stands in contrast to the discretionary access
control (DAC) model found in most modern operating systems where the
owner of a file or resource controls the permissions on that resource and
can delegate them at his or her discretion.
MAC systems are very unwieldy and, therefore, are rarely used outside of
very sensitive government and military applications. Security Enhanced
Linux (SE Linux), an operating system developed by the U.S. National
Security Agency, is an example of a system that enforces mandatory
access controls.
www.hellodigi.ir

Penetration Testing
In addition to bearing responsibility for the design and implementation of
security controls, cybersecurity analysts are responsible for monitoring the
ongoing effectiveness of those controls. Penetration testing is one of the
techniques they use to fulfill this obligation. During a penetration test, the
testers simulate an attack against the organization using the same
information, tools, and techniques available to real attackers. They seek to
gain access to systems and information and then report their findings to
management. The results of penetration tests may be used to bolster an
organization’s security controls.
Penetration tests may be performed by an organization’s internal staff or by
external consultants. In the case of internal tests, they require highly skilled
individuals and are quite time-consuming. External tests mitigate these
concerns but are often quite expensive to conduct. Despite these barriers to
penetration tests, organizations should try to perform them periodically since
a well-designed and well-executed penetration test is one of the best
measures of an organization’s cybersecurity posture.
NIST divides penetration testing into the four phases shown in Figure 1.9.
Figure 1.9  NIST divides penetration testing into four phases.
Source: NIST SP 800-115: Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment
Planning a Penetration Test
The planning phase of a penetration test lays the administrative groundwork
www.hellodigi.ir

for the test. No technical work is performed during the planning phase, but it
is a critical component of any penetration test. There are three important
rules of engagement to finalize during the planning phase:
Timing  When will the test take place? Will technology staff be informed of
the test? Can it be timed to have as little impact on business operations as
possible?
Scope  What is the agreed-upon scope of the penetration test? Are any
systems, networks, personnel, or business processes off-limits to the testers?
Authorization  Who is authorizing the penetration test to take place? What
should testers do if they are confronted by an employee or other individual
who notices their suspicious activity?
These details are administrative in nature, but it is important to agree on
them up front and in writing to avoid problems during and after the
penetration test.
   You should never conduct a penetration test without permission.
Not only is an unauthorized test unethical, it may be illegal.
Conducting Discovery
The technical work of the penetration test begins during the discovery phase
when attackers conduct reconnaissance and gather as much information as
possible about the targeted network, systems, users, and applications. This
may include conducting reviews of publicly available material, performing
port scans of systems, using network vulnerability scanners and web
application testers to probe for vulnerabilities, and performing other
information gathering.
   Vulnerability scanning is an important component of
penetration testing. This topic is covered extensively in Chapters 3 and 4.
Executing a Penetration Test
During the attack phase, penetration testers seek to bypass the organization’s
www.hellodigi.ir

security controls and gain access to systems and applications run by the
organization. Testers often follow the NIST attack process shown in Figure
1.10.
Figure 1.10  The attack phase of a penetration test uses a cyclical process that
gains a foothold and then uses it to expand access within the target
organization.
Source: NIST SP 800-115: Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment
In this process, attackers use the information gathered during the discovery
phase to gain initial access to a system. Once they establish a foothold, they
then seek to escalate their access until they gain complete administrative
control of the system. From there, they can scan for additional system on the
network, install additional penetration testing tools, and begin the cycle anew,
seeking to expand their footprint within the targeted organization. They
continue this cycle until they exhaust the possibilities or the time allotted for
the test expires.
www.hellodigi.ir

   The attack phase of a penetration test is also known as the
exploitation phase. Questions on the exam referring to test execution, the
attack phase, and the exploitation phase are all referring to the same
thing.
Communicating Penetration Test Results
At the conclusion of the penetration test, the testers prepare a detailed report
communicating the access they were able to achieve and the vulnerabilities
they exploited to gain this access. The results of penetration tests are valuable
security planning tools, as they describe the actual vulnerabilities that an
attacker might exploit to gain access to a network. Penetration testing reports
typically contain detailed appendixes that include the results of various tests
and may be shared with system administrators responsible for remediating
issues.
Training and Exercises
In addition to performing penetration tests, some organizations choose to run
wargame exercises that pit teams of security professionals against each other
in a cyberdefense scenario. These exercises are typically performed in
simulated environments, rather than on production networks, and seek to
improve the skills of security professionals on both sides by exposing them to
the tools and techniques used by attackers. Three teams are involved in most
cybersecurity wargames:The red team plays the role of the attacker and uses reconnaissance and
exploitation tools to attempt to gain access to the protected network. The
red team’s work is similar to that of the testers during a penetration test.
The blue team is responsible for securing the targeted environment and
keeping the red team out by building, maintaining, and monitoring a
comprehensive set of security controls.
The white team coordinates the exercise and serves as referees, arbitrating
disputes between the team, maintaining the technical environment, and
monitoring the results.
Cybersecurity wargames can be an effective way to educate security
www.hellodigi.ir

professionals on modern attack and defense tactics.
www.hellodigi.ir

Reverse Engineering
In many cases, vendors do not release the details of how hardware and
software work. Certainly, the authors of malicious software don’t explain
their work to the world. In these situations, security professionals may be in
the dark about the security of their environments. Reverse engineering is a
technique used to work backward from a finished product to figure out how it
works. Security professionals sometimes use reverse engineering to learn the
inner workings of suspicious software or inspect the integrity of hardware.
Reverse engineering uses a philosophy known as decomposition where the
reverse engineer starts with the finished product and works his or her way
back to its component parts.
Isolation and Sandboxing
One of the most dangerous threats to the security of modern organizations is
customized malware developed by APT actors who create specialized tools
designed to penetrate a single target. Since they have never been used before,
these tools are not detectable with the signature-detection technology used by
traditional antivirus software.
Sandboxing is an approach used to detect malicious software based on its
behavior rather than its signatures. Sandboxing systems watch systems and
the network for unknown pieces of code and, when they detect an application
that has not been seen before, immediately isolate that code in a special
environment known as a sandbox where it does not have access to any other
systems or applications. The sandboxing solution then executes the code and
watches how it behaves, checking to see if it begins scanning the network for
other systems, gathering sensitive information, communicating with a
command-and-control server, or performing any other potentially malicious
activity.
If the sandboxing solution identifies strange behavior, it blocks the code from
entering the organization’s network and flags it for administrator review. This
process, also known as code detonation, is an example of an automated
reverse engineering technique that takes action based on the observed
behavior of software.
Reverse Engineering Software
www.hellodigi.ir

In most programming languages, developers write software in a human-
readable language such as C/C++, Java, Ruby, or Python. Depending on the
programming language, the computer may process this code in one of two
ways. In interpreted languages, such as Ruby and Python, the computer
works directly from the source code. Reverse engineers seeking to analyze
code written in interpreted languages can simply read through the code and
often get a good idea of what the code is attempting to accomplish.
In compiled languages, such as Java and C/C++, the developer uses a tool
called a compiler to convert the source code into binary code that is readable
by the computer. This binary code is what is often distributed to users of the
software, and it is very difficult, if not impossible, to examine binary code and
determine what it is doing, making the reverse engineering of compiled
languages much more difficult. Technologists seeking to reverse engineer
compiled code have two options. First, they can attempt to use a specialized
program known as a decompiler to convert the binary code back to source
code. Unfortunately, however, this process usually does not work very well.
Second, they can instrument a specialized environment and carefully monitor
how software responds to different inputs in an attempt to discover its inner
workings. In either case, reverse engineering compiled software is extremely
difficult.
   
    Fingerprinting Software
Although it is difficult to reverse engineer compiled code, technologists
can easily detect whether two pieces of compiled code are identical or
whether one has been modified. Hashing is a mathematical technique
that analyzes a file and computes a unique fingerprint, known as a
message digest or hash, for that file. Analysts using hash functions, such
as the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), can compute the hashes of two files
and compare the output values. If the hashes are identical, the file
contents are identical. If the hashes differ, the two files contain at least
one difference. Hashing software is covered in more detail in Chapter 13,
“Cybersecurity Toolkit.”
Reverse Engineering Hardware
www.hellodigi.ir

Reverse engineering hardware is even more difficult than reverse engineering
software because the authenticity of hardware often rests in the invisible code
embedded within integrated circuits and firmware contents. Although
organizations may perform a physical inspection of hardware to detect
tampering, it is important to verify that hardware has source authenticity,
meaning that it comes from a trusted, reliable source, because it is simply too
difficult to exhaustively test hardware.
The U.S. government recognizes the difficulty of ensuring source authenticity
and operates a trusted foundry program for critical defense systems. The
Department of Defense and National Security Agency (NSA) certify
companies as trusted foundries that are approved to create sensitive
integrated circuits for government use. Companies seeking trusted foundry
status must show that they completely secure the production process,
including design, prototyping, packing, assembly, and other elements of the
process.
Reverse engineers seeking to determine the function of hardware use some of
the same techniques used for compiled software, particularly when it comes
to observing behavior. Operating a piece of hardware in a controlled
environment and observing how it responds to different inputs provides clues
to the functions performed in the hardware. Reverse engineers may also seek
to obtain documentation from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)
that provide insight into how components of a piece of hardware function.

government has engaged in reverse engineering of hardware designed to
circumvent security.

factory and before it reached the customer. They then opened the
packages and inserted covert firmware into the devices that facilitated

Summary
Cybersecurity professionals are responsible for ensuring the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of information and systems maintained by their
organizations. Confidentiality ensures that unauthorized individuals are not
able to gain access to sensitive information. Integrity ensures that there are
no unauthorized modifications to information or systems, either intentionally
or unintentionally. Availability ensures that information and systems are
ready to meet the needs of legitimate users at the time those users request
them. Together, these three goals are known as the CIA Triad.
As cybersecurity analysts seek to protect their organizations, they must
evaluate risks to the CIA Triad. This includes identifying vulnerabilities,
recognizing corresponding threats, and determining the level of risk that
results from vulnerability and threat combinations. Analysts must then
evaluate each risk and identify appropriate risk management strategies to
mitigate or otherwise address the risk.
Cybersecurity analysts mitigate risks using security controls designed to
reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk. Network security controls include
network access control (NAC) systems, firewalls, and network segmentation.
Secure endpoint controls include hardened system configurations, patch
management, Group Policies, and endpoint security software.
Penetration tests and reverse engineering provide analysts with the
reassurance that the controls they’ve implemented to mitigate risks are
functioning properly. By following a careful risk analysis and control process,
analysts significantly enhance the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
information and systems under their control.

Exam Essentials
The three objectives of cybersecurity are confidentiality, integrity,
and availability.  Confidentiality ensures that unauthorized individuals are
not able to gain access to sensitive information. Integrity ensures that there
are no unauthorized modifications to information or systems, either
intentionally or unintentionally. Availability ensures that information and
systems are ready to meet the needs of legitimate users at the time those
users request them.
Cybersecurity risks result from the combination of a threat and a
vulnerability.  A vulnerability is a weakness in a device, system, application,
or process that might allow an attack to take place. A threat in the world of
cybersecurity is an outside force that may exploit a vulnerability.
Cybersecurity threats may be categorized as adversarial, accidental,
structural, or environmental.  Adversarial threats are individuals, groups,
and organizations that are attempting to deliberately undermine the security
of an organization. Accidental threats occur when individuals doing their
routine work mistakenly perform an action that undermines security.
Structural threats occur when equipment, software, or environmental
controls fail due to the exhaustion of resources, exceeding their operational
capability or simply failing due to age. Environmental threats occur when
natural or man-made disasters occur that are outside the control of the
organization.
Networks are made more secure through the use of network access
control, firewalls, and segmentation.  Network access control (NAC)
solutions help security professionals achieve two cybersecurity objectives:
limiting network access to authorized individuals and ensuring that systems
accessing the organization’s network meet basic security requirements.
Network firewalls sit at the boundaries between networks and provide
perimeter security. Network segmentation uses isolation to separate
networks of differing security levels from each other.
Endpoints are made more secure through the use of hardened
configurations, patch management, Group Policy, and endpoint
security software.  Hardening configurations includes disabling any
unnecessary services on the endpoints to reduce their susceptibility to attack,
ensuring that secure configuration settings exist on devices and centrally
controlling device security settings. Patch management ensures that
www.hellodigi.ir

operating systems and applications are not susceptible to known
vulnerabilities. Group Policy allows the application of security settings to
many devices simultaneously, and endpoint security software protects against
malicious software and other threats.
Penetration tests provide organizations with an attacker’s
perspective on their security.  The NIST process for penetration testing
divides tests into four phases: planning, discovery, attack, and reporting. The
results of penetration tests are valuable security planning tools, since they
describe the actual vulnerabilities that an attacker might exploit to gain
access to a network.
Reverse engineering techniques attempt to determine how
hardware and software functions internally.  Sandboxing is an
approach used to detect malicious software based on its behavior rather than
its signatures. Other reverse engineering techniques are difficult to perform,
are often unsuccessful, and are quite time-consuming.

23. Click OK to close the window.
24. Click the X to exit Group Policy Editor
You have now successfully created a Group Policy Object that enforces the
organization’s password policy. You may apply this GPO to users and/or
groups as needed.
Activity 1.3: Write a Penetration Testing Plan
For this activity, design a penetration testing plan for a test against an
organization of your choosing. If you are employed, you may choose to use
your employer’s network. If you are a student, you may choose to create a
plan for a penetration test of your school. Otherwise, you may choose any
organization, real or fictitious, of your choice.
Your penetration testing plan should cover the three main criteria required
before initiating any penetration test:Timing
Scope
Authorization
One word of warning: You should not conduct a penetration test without
permission of the network owner. This assignment only asks you to design
the test on paper.
Activity 1.4: Security Tools
Match each of the security tools listed in this table with the correct
