Acknowledgments
As we were putting together this book, I was reminded of the proverb that begins “It takes 
a small village….” That beginning definitely holds true to create a book of this scope and 
size. From beginning to end, scores of dedicated professionals have focused on delivering 
the best book possible to you, the readers.
First, I need to thank my coauthor Jon Buhagiar. I appreciate him diving in and dedicat-
ing himself to helping to produce an excellent book. I also need to give special thanks to 
our technical editor, Chris Crayton. He was meticulous and thorough, and challenged me 
to always find new and better ways to communicate complex concepts. His entire focus was 
on providing the best training material possible, and I doubt there’s better in the business. 
Now, on to the rest of the team.
Kenyon Brown and Tom Cirtin kept us on track and moving forward, which was a chal-
lenge at times. Christine O’Connor had the fun job of keeping us organized, which is akin 
to herding cats. Copyeditor John Sleeva reminded me yet again that I am no master of the 
English language and saved me from butchering it (too badly). Many thanks also go out to 
proofreader, Nancy Carrasco and our indexer, Ted Laux. Without their great contribu-
tions, this book would not have made it into your hands.
On a personal note, I need to thank my family. My girls are all incredibly supportive. 
Unfortunately, writing a book as my slash while holding down a full-time job takes up a lot 
of time. I end up hiding in my office a lot, but they’re always there for me, and I couldn’t do 
it without them. Another huge thanks goes to my late grandpa, Joe, who got me into com-
puters and taught me so many lessons I will never be able to repay. Finally, thanks to my 
friends who keep me relatively sane—Sean, Kurtis, Tim, John, and others—and laugh at 
me when I tell them I spent my weekend writing about the laser printer imaging process.
—Quentin Docter
I would like to first thank my coauthor Quentin Docter. Throughout the writing of this 
book, he helped me with his insight and his expertise in writing technical books. Without 
his words of wisdom and guidance, this book would not be the product it stands to be. I 
would also like to give special thanks to our technical editor, Chris Crayton. His thorough 
review of the material helped to identify many areas to elaborate on and polish.
I would also like to take the time to thank the many people who made this book pos-
sible: Kenyon Brown, at Wiley Publishing, for giving me the opportunity to write this book 
and work with this wonderful team; Tom Cirtin, for keeping us on track during the writing 
process; Christine O’Connor, who also kept us on track and organized during the publish-
ing process; and our copyeditor, John Sleeva, for helping me realize my use of IT slang at 
times and proper English. I’d also like to thank the many other people I’ve never met but 
who worked behind the scenes to make this book a success.
During the writing of this book, many others in my life supported me, and I’d like to 
take this opportunity to thank them, as well. First and foremost, thanks to my wife and 
son for their support during the many evenings and weekends spent in my office at the com-
puter. Finally, thanks to my friend and co-worker, Bill, for encouraging me daily with his 
insight and jokes, as well as to all of my other co-workers and friends. Thank you.

Introduction
Welcome to the CompTIA A+ Complete Study Guide . This is the fourth edition of our 
best-selling study guide for the A+ certification sponsored by CompTIA (Computing 
Technology Industry Association).
This book is written at an intermediate technical level; we assume that you already 
know how to use a personal computer and its basic peripherals, such as USB devices and 
printers, but we also recognize that you may be learning how to service  some of that com-
puter equipment for the first time. The exams cover basic computer service topics as well 
as some more advanced issues, and they cover some topics that anyone already working 
as a technician, whether with computers or not, should be familiar with. The exams are 
designed to test you on these topics in order to certify that you have enough knowledge to 
fix and upgrade some of the most widely used types of personal computers.
We’ve included review questions at the end of each chapter to give you a taste of what 
it’s like to take the exams. If you’re already working as a technical service or support 
technician, we recommend that you check out these questions first to gauge your level of 
knowledge. (You can also take the assessment test at the end of this introduction, which is 
designed to see how much you already know.)
Don’t just study the questions and answers—the questions on the actual exams will be 
different from the practice ones included with this book. The exams are designed to test 
your knowledge of a concept or objective, so use this book to learn the objective behind the 
question. This book covers more than just the exams, however. We believe in providing our 
students with a foundation of IT knowledge that will prepare them for real jobs, not just 
to pass a test. After all, life is not a multiple-choice test with the answers clearly laid out in 
front of you!
You can mainly use the book to fill in the gaps in your current computer service knowl-
edge. You may find, as many PC technicians have, that being well versed in all the technical 
aspects of the equipment is not enough to provide a satisfactory level of support—you must 
also have customer-relations skills. We include helpful hints to get the customers to help 
you help them.
What Is A+ Certification?
The A+ certification program was developed by the Computing Technology Industry 
Association (CompTIA) to provide an industry-wide means of certifying the competency 
of computer service technicians. The A+ certification is granted to those who have attained 
the level of knowledge and troubleshooting skills that are needed to provide capable sup-
port in the field of personal computers. It is similar to other certifications in the computer 
industry, such as the Cisco Certified Entry Network Technician (CCENT) program and 
the Microsoft Technology Associate (MTA) certification program. The theory behind these 
certifications is that if you need to have service performed on any of their products, you 

xxxiv Introduction
would sooner call a technician who has been certified in one of the appropriate certification 
programs than just call the first “expert” in the phone book.
The A+ certification program was created to offer a wide-ranging certification, in the 
sense that it is intended to certify competence with personal computers and mobile devices 
from many different makers/vendors. You must pass two tests to become A+ certified:
 ■The A+ 220-1001 exam, which covers basic computer concepts, PC hardware, basic 
networking, mobile devices, and hardware troubleshooting
 ■The A+ 220-1002 exam, which covers operating systems, security, software trouble-
shooting, and operational procedures
You don’t have to take the 220-1001 and the 220-1002 exams at the same time. 
However, the A+ certification is not awarded until you’ve passed both tests.
Why Become A+ Certified?
There are several good reasons to get your A+ certification. The CompTIA Candidate’s 
Information packet lists five major benefits:
 ■It demonstrates proof of professional achievement.
 ■It increases your marketability.
 ■It provides greater opportunity for advancement in your field.
 ■It is increasingly a requirement for some types of advanced training.
 ■It raises customer confidence in you and your company’s services.
Provides Proof of Professional Achievement
The A+ certification is a status symbol in the computer service industry. Organizations that 
include members of the computer service industry recognize the benefits of A+ certification 
and push for their members to become certified. And more people every day are putting the 
“A+ Certified Technician” emblem on their business cards.
Increases Your Marketability
A+ certification makes individuals more marketable to potential employers. A+ certified 
employees also may receive a higher base salary because employers won’t have to spend as 
much money on vendor-specific training.
Provides Opportunity for Advancement
Most raises and advancements are based on performance. A+ certified employees work 
faster and more efficiently and are thus more productive. The more productive employees 
are, the more money they make for their company. And, of course, the more money they 
make for the company, the more valuable they are to the company. So, if an employee is A+ 
certified, their chances of being promoted are greater.

Introduction  xxxv
 Fulfills Training Requirements 
 Most major computer hardware vendors recognize A+ certifi  cation. Some of these vendors 
apply A+ certifi  cation toward prerequisites in their own respective certifi  cation programs, 
which has the side benefi  t of reducing training costs for employers.   
 Raises Customer Confidence 
 As the A+ Certifi  ed Technician moniker becomes better known among computer owners, 
more of them will realize that the A+ technician is more qualifi  ed to work on their com-
puter equipment than a noncertifi  ed technician.    
 How to Become A+ Certified 
 A+ certifi  cation is available to anyone who passes the tests. You don’t have to work for any 
particular company. It’s not a secret society. It is, however, an elite group. To become A+ 
certifi  ed, you must do two things: 
 ■   Pass the A+ 220-1001 exam 
 ■   Pass the A+ 220-1002 exam   
 The exams can be taken at any Pearson VUE testing center. If you pass both exams, you 
will get a certifi  cate in the mail from CompTIA saying that you have passed, and you will 
also receive a lapel pin and business card. 
 To register for the tests, call Pearson VUE at (877) 551-PLUS (7587) or go to 
www.pearsonvue.com/comptia  . You’ll be asked for your name, Social Security number 
(an optional number may be assigned if you don’t wish to provide your Social Security 
number), mailing address, phone number, employer, when and where you want to take the 
test, and your credit card number. (Payment arrangements must be made at the time of 
registration.) 
        
 Although you can save money by arranging to take more than one test at 
the same seating, there are no other discounts. If you have to repeat a test 
to get a passing grade, you must pay for each retake.     
 Tips for Taking the A+ Exam 
 Here are some general tips for taking your exam successfully: 
 ■   Bring two forms of ID with you. One must be a photo ID, such as a driver’s license. 
The other can be a major credit card or a passport. Both forms must include a 
signature. 
 ■   Arrive early at the exam center so that you can relax and review your study materials, 
particularly tables and lists of exam-related information. When you enter the testing 

xxxvi Introduction
room, you will need to leave everything outside; you won’t be able to bring any materi-
als into the testing area.
 ■Read the questions carefully. Don’t be tempted to jump to an early conclusion. Make 
sure that you know exactly what each question is asking.
 ■Don’t leave any unanswered questions. Unanswered questions are scored against you. 
Some questions will have multiple correct responses. When a question has more than 
one correct answer, a message at the bottom of the screen will prompt you to, for 
example, choose two. Be sure to read the messages displayed to know how many cor-
rect answers you must choose.
 ■When answering multiple-choice questions that you’re not sure about, use a process of 
elimination to get rid of the obviously incorrect answers first. Doing so will improve 
your odds if you need to make an educated guess.
 ■On form-based tests (nonadaptive), because the hard questions will take the most time, 
save them for last. You can move forward and backward through the exam.

xxxviii Introduction
Part II of the book, Chapters 15–26, covers all the topics on which you will be tested for 
Exam 220-1002:
Chapter 15: Operating System Basics   Chapter 15 starts the examination of Microsoft 
Windows operating systems. CompTIA expects you to know how to administer three of 
them—Windows 10, Windows 8/8.1, and Windows 7. In addition, you will need to know 
about many of the various editions of each version.
Chapter 16: Operating System Administration   Chapter 16 continues the discussion begun 
in Chapter 15, looking at utilities and features that exist in each of the three versions of 
Windows operating systems that you need to know for the exam.
Chapter 17: Working with Windows 10   Chapter 17 covers unique features and capabili-
ties of Windows 10, the newest of the three versions of Windows operating systems tested 
on the 220-1002 exam.

shows you technologies used to do just that. Scripting is also included.
Chapter 22: Security Concepts   Just when you think this book couldn’t get any better, 
we toss in a chapter devoted to security. This chapter introduces key security concepts you 
need to know for the exam, including information on physical security, social engineering, 
wireless networks, best practices, and data destruction methods.
Chapter 23: Securing Operating Systems   This chapter follows up on Chapter 22, which 
introduced security concepts, by providing specifics on how to secure Microsoft and mobile 
operating systems, prevent and remove malware, and configure network security on wired 
and wireless networks.
Chapter 24: Troubleshooting Operating Systems and Security   Troubleshooting is a major 
part of almost every technician’s job. In Chapter 24, we talk about troubleshooting com-
mon operating system issues as well as security challenges you may encounter.
Chapter 25: Documentation and Professionalism   This chapter covers the “softer” side of 
working with computers. Specifically, you learn to practice proper communication, show 
professionalism, and implement best practices associated with documentation and change 
management.

Introduction  xxxix
Chapter 26: Safety and Environmental Concerns   The final chapter discusses the impacts 
computers can have on people as well as the environment. You learn how to avoid dam-
aging a computer as well as having it damage you, how to perform backups and disaster 
recovery, and how to properly dispose of computer components that are no longer needed.
What’s Included in the Book
We’ve included several learning tools throughout the book:
Assessment Tests   At the end of this introduction are two assessment tests—one for each 
exam—that you can use to check your readiness for the exams. Take these tests before you 
start reading the book; they will help you determine the areas on which you might need to 
brush up. The answers to the assessment test questions appear on a separate page after the 
last question of the test. Each answer includes an explanation and the chapter the material 
appears in.
Objective Map and Opening List of Objectives   At the beginning of the book, we have 
included a detailed exam objective map that shows you where each exam objective is cov-
ered. In addition, each chapter opens with a list of the exam objectives it covers. Use these 
resources to see exactly where each exam topic is covered.
Exam Essentials   Each chapter, just before the summary, includes a number of “exam 
essentials.” These are the key topics that you should focus on when preparing for the exam.
Chapter Review Questions   To test your knowledge as you progress through the book, 
each chapter ends with review questions. As you finish each chapter, answer the review 
questions and then check your answers—the correct answers and explanations are in 
Appendix A. You can go back to reread the section that deals with each question you got 
wrong to ensure that you answer correctly the next time that you’re tested on the material.
Performance-Based Questions   The A+ exams may ask you to perform tasks to correctly 
answer a question. This may mean dragging and dropping items into the correct order or 
clicking the correct area of an image or screenshot. While it’s hard to simulate those in a 
paper book, the end of each chapter features a performance-based question. These ques-
tions will have you think through a topic presented in the chapter, and then perform a task.
Interactive Online Learning Environment and Test Bank

 How to Use This Book 
 If you want a solid foundation for preparing for the A+ exams, this is the book for you. 
We’ve spent countless hours putting together this book with the intention of helping you 
prepare for the exams. 
 This book is loaded with valuable information, and you will get the most out of your 
study time if you understand how we put the book together. Here’s a list that describes how 
to approach studying: 
  1.  Take the assessment tests immediately following this introduction. It’s okay if you don’t 
know any of the answers—that’s what this book is for. Carefully read over the expla-
nations for any questions you get wrong, and make note of the chapters where that 
material is covered. 
  2.  Study each chapter carefully, making sure you fully understand the information and 
the exam objectives listed at the beginning of the chapter. Again, pay extra-close 
attention to any chapter that includes material covered in questions you missed on the 
assessment test. 
  3.  Read over the Summary and Exam Essentials. These will highlight the sections from the 
chapter you need to be familiar with before sitting for the exam. 
  4.  Answer all the review questions at the end of each chapter. Specifically note any ques-
tions that confuse you, and study the corresponding sections of the book again. Don’t 
just skim these questions. Make sure that you understand each answer completely. 
  5.  Go over the electronic flashcards. These help you to prepare for the latest A+ exams, 
and they’re really great study tools. 
  6.  Take the practice exams.   
      Performance-Based Questions  
 CompTIA includes performance-based questions on the A+ exams. These are not the tra-
ditional multiple-choice questions with which you’re probably familiar. These questions 
require the candidate to know how to perform a specifi  c task or series of tasks. The can-
didate will be presented with a scenario and will be asked to complete a task. They will be 

Introduction  xli
taken to a simulated environment where they will have to perform a series of steps and 
will be graded on how well they complete the task.
The Sybex test engine does not include performance-based questions. However, at the 
end of most chapters, we have included a section called “Performance-Based Question,” 
which is designed to measure how well you understood the chapter’s topics. Some sim-
ply ask you to complete a task for which there is only one correct response. Others are 
more subjective, with multiple ways to complete the task. We provide the most logical 
or practical solution in Appendix B. Note that these questions may cover topic areas not 
covered in the actual A+ performance-based questions. However, we feel that being able 
to think logically is a great way to learn.
The CompTIA A+ Exam Objectives
The A+ exams consist of the 220-1001 exam and the 220-1002 exam. Following are the 
detailed exam objectives for each test.
Exam objectives are subject to change at any time without prior notice and at 
CompTIA’s sole discretion. Please visit the A+ Certification page of CompTIA’s website 
(https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/a ) for the most current listing of

Answers to Assessment Test 220-1001
1. C .  S ystem components are essential for the basic functionality of a computer system. Many 
of the landmarks found on the motherboard can be considered system components, even 
expansion slots, to a degree. What you plug into those slots, however, must be considered 
peripheral to the basic operation of the system. See Chapter 1 for more information.
2. A. DIMMs are a type of memory module. HDD is a hard drive, and SSD is a solid-state 
drive—both are for permanent long-term storage. RAM is what memory is called, but it is 
not a physical memory format. See Chapter 1 for more information.
3. A, B. Motherboards commonly have RAM slots and expansion slots. Older motherboards 
even had CPU slots. Modern motherboards have connectors for powering cooling fans. 
Gyroscopes are most commonly found in mobile devices. Scanners are external devices. 
Although there might be one or more types of HDD interfaces built into the motherboard, 
the HDD itself is not. See Chapter 1 for more information.
4. A. DL stands for double (or dual) layer. With DVDs, the capacity almost doubles, but with 
Blu-ray Discs, it actually does. R means recordable, and RW and RE are used to designate 
re-writeable or re-recordable, respectively. See Chapter 2 for more information.
5. C. The standard peripheral power connector, or Molex connector, is commonly used on 
larger drives because it allows more current to flow to the drive than smaller peripheral 
connectors. AT and ATX system connectors are used to connect the power supply to the 
motherboard. A Berg connector was used for floppy disk drives. See Chapter 2 for more 
information.
6. C, D. Except for RAID 0, all implementations of RAID offer a way to recover from 
the failure of at least one drive, which is an example of fault tolerance, through the 
implementation of some mechanism that stores redundant information for that purpose. 
Some RAID types offer faster read and/or write performance. RAID 1, for instance, does 
not guarantee either. See Chapter 2 for more information.
7. A. The native resolution refers to how many pixels an LCD screen can display (across and 
down) without distortion. The native resolution is based on the placement of the actual 
transistors that create the image by twisting the liquid crystals. The contrast ratio is the 
measurement between the darkest color and the lightest color that an LCD screen can 
display. Monitors do not measure contrast ratio. Aspect ratio measures the width of the 
image versus its height. See Chapter 3 for more information.
8. D. DVI comes in both analog (DVI-A) and digital (DVI-D) varieties. VGA is always analog, 
HDMI and DisplayPort are always digital. See Chapter 3 for more information.
9. C, D. USB cables are multipurpose cables that connect many types of peripherals. 
Connectors include USB-C, Lightning, and eSATA. Molex connectors provide power to 
PATA hard drives and optical drives. A DB-9 connector is found on the end of a serial 
cable. See Chapter 3 for more information.

lxxxiv Answers to Assessment Test 220-1001
10. D .  A t hick client is any computer system with a standard configuration. The gaming PC 
has enhancements over thick clients to their CPU, video, audio, and cooling. The NAS 
(network-attached storage) must have specialized capabilities and services along with a 
faster NIC than the thick client and a RAID array. The thin client is a lesser device in 
comparison to the thick client, but that cost-saving feature is its enhancement. These less 
expensive computers can connect over the network to servers for their operating system 
images and applications. See Chapter 4 for more information.
11. C. Virtualization workstations require more RAM than standard systems and need to be 
equipped with as many multicore processors as possible. Video and audio are not resources 
that need to be enhanced for such workstations. Although a RAID array is a wise addition 
whenever a NAS with valuable information is involved, a virtualization workstation does 
not require one. See Chapter 4 for more information.
12. A. Dual monitors are not required for a network-attached storage (NAS) device; it might 
not even use a monitor. A NAS will use file sharing and benefit from a Gigabit NIC and 
RAID array. See Chapter 4 for more information.
13. C. The laser creates an image on the photosensitive drum that is then transferred to the 
paper by the transfer corona. The fuser heats up the toner so that it adheres to the page. 
The transfer corona charges the page, and the eraser lamp cleans the drum before a page is 
printed. A rubber blade is also used to remove toner physically from the drum. See Chapter 
5 for more information.
14. A. Laser printers use toner, which they melt to the page in the image of the text and 
graphics being printed. A toner cartridge holds the fine toner dust until it is used in the 
printing process. See Chapter 5 for more information.
15. C. AirPrint was created by Apple to let iPhones and iPads print without installing a printer 
driver. See Chapter 5 for more information.
16. C. A router does not pass along broadcasts to computers on other segments. Hubs and 
switches send broadcasts along because they do not segment traffic at the logical network 
address level. See Chapter 6 for more information.
17. A. The plenum is an air space within buildings used to circulate breathable air for 
occupants of a building. Fiber, coaxial, and UTP cables are normally enclosed with a 
PVC plastic coating, which produces toxic fumes when burned. For air ventilation spaces, 
plenum-grade cable is required. All cable types have plenum-rated versions. See Chapter 6 
for more information.
18. A, B. RG-6 and RG-59 are coaxial cable standards. RJ-11 and RJ-45 are connectors used 
with twisted-pair cabling. See Chapter 6 for more information.
19. A. FTP operates on ports 20 and 21. Port 25 is used by SMTP, port 53 by DNS, and port 
80 by HTTP. See Chapter 7 for more information.
20. D. The IMAP and POP3 protocols can be used to retrieve email from mail servers. DNS 
is used to resolve host names to IP addresses. FTP is for file transfers, and SMTP is used to 
send email. See Chapter 7 for more information.

21. C , D.  Secure Shell (SSH) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) are both secure 
transport protocols. Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and Simple Mail 
Transfer Protocol (SMTP) are not inherently secure. See Chapter 7 for more information.
22. B. An Internet service provider (ISP) provides direct access to the Internet. ASP is a 
programming language. DNS resolves host names to IP addresses. DNP is not a computer 
networking acronym. See Chapter 8 for more information.
23. C. An ISDN B (bearer) channel provides 64 Kbps data throughput. A home-based BRI 
ISDN provides two B channels. See Chapter 8 for more information.
24. D. Zigbee and Z-Wave were developed specifically for the Internet of Things (IoT). Zigbee 
can communicate in the 2.4 GHz range as well as the 800 MHz to 900 MHz range. 
Z-Wave can communicate only in the 800 MHz to 900 MHz range. See Chapter 8 for more 
information.
25. C. A proxy server can be configured to block access to websites containing potentially 
objectionable material. Web servers host websites. There is no specific security server, 
although there are authentication servers, which provide security. A DNS server resolves 
host names to IP addresses. See Chapter 9 for more information.
26. A. Google Docs is software, so it is an example of Software as a Service (SaaS). IaaS is 
Infrastructure as a Service. PaaS is Platform as a Service. GaaS is neither a test objective nor 
currently a cloud service type. See Chapter 9 for more information.
27. D. The hypervisor is the key piece of software needed for virtualization. Terminal 
emulation, process replication, and hyperthreading are not related to client-side 
virtualization. See Chapter 9 for more information.
28. A. The backlight provides light to the LCD screen. The inverter provides power to the 
backlight, and the screen displays the picture. Digitizers take physical input (such as touch) 
and turn it into electronic data. See Chapter 10 for more information.
29. B. If the laptop is using shared video memory, then the system memory is shared with the 
video card. If the video card is using 512 MB (half a gigabyte), then there is 3.5 GB left for 
the system. See Chapter 10 for more information.
30. D. Most systems with a keyboard backlight have a keyboard function key to turn the 
backlight on or off—try that first. If not, there is likely a setting in Windows Control Panel, 
or possibly the BIOS. Replacing the backlight is the last resort. See Chapter 10 for more 
information.
31. D. Capacitive touch screens react to slight changes in electrical charges. The human finger is 
used as an input device for capacitive touch screens. For more information, see Chapter 11.
32. C. E-readers use electrophoretic ink, also known as E Ink. E Ink uses less energy than 
other LCD displays, prolonging battery life. For more information, see Chapter 11.
33. B. Card emulation mode, reader/writer mode, and peer-to-peer mode are the three valid 
NFC communication modes. For two devices to transmit to each other, they will use peer-
to-peer mode. For more information, see Chapter 11.

lxxxvi Answers to Assessment Test 220-1001
34. B .  B luetooth allows you to pair a mobile device to a computer or to a device such as 
an automotive sound system or headset. Data can be transferred between devices, and 
media can be streamed from the mobile device. SMTP is an email protocol. NFC is 
for short-distance data transfers, but not media streaming. Pegasus is not a computer 
communications protocol. For more information, see Chapter 12.
35. D. Synchronizing a mobile device with a computer system allows you to mirror personal 
data between the devices, regardless of which one contains the most current data. 
Calibration refers to matching the device’s and user’s perceptions of where the user is 
touching the screen. Remote wipes allow you to remove personal data from a lost or stolen 
device. Pairing is what must be done in Bluetooth for two Bluetooth devices to connect and 
communicate. For more information, see Chapter 12.
36. C. The Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) standard for public key 
encryption is used to create and read encrypted emails. POP3 and SMTP are standard email 
protocols. VPNs create a private network over a public network, but they do not encrypt 
email content. For more information, see Chapter 12.
37. B. In the best practice methodology to resolve problems, the first step is to identify the 
problem. Quarantining the system is not necessary. Establishing a theory of probable cause 
is the second step, and establishing a plan of action is the fourth step. See Chapter 13 for 
more information.
38. C. Switches and other connectivity devices have indicator lights to help indicate when 
things are working normally and when something isn’t working right. There are no port 
toggles, and switches don’t use beep codes. A switch might make a log entry into an 
event logger, but this is less likely than it having indicator lights. See Chapter 13 for more 
information.
39. C. White streaks on printouts are most likely caused by toner on the transfer corona wire. 
Vertical black lines are caused by a scratch or a groove in the EP drum. If the fuser were not 
heating properly, toner would not bond to the paper, and you would have smearing. Faulty 
printer drivers will cause garbage to print, or there will be no printing at all. See Chapter 14 
for more information.
40. B. Hard drive performance can slow down if the drive gets short on space, particularly 
under 10 percent of free space. First, try removing old files and applications to free up disk 
space. If that doesn’t resolve it, then defragment. If neither of those work, you could have a 
failing hard drive. See Chapter 14 for more information.
41. B, C. A multimeter is specifically designed to test for electrical characteristics, so it would 
be the best tool to choose. Cable testers are for verifying that a cable works properly; some 
are capable of testing resistance. A loopback plug is for testing the ability of a network 
adapter to send and receive. A tone generator and probe is used to trace a cable from one 
location to another. See Chapter 14 for more information.

Answers to Assessment Test 220-1002
1. B .  A n application is written to perform a specific task for the user, such as word processing 
and data analysis. Drivers allow for the operating system to communicate with the 
hardware. The operating system and the filesystem assist in running applications. See 
Chapter 15 for more information.
2. D. The Google Chrome OS is a true cloud-based operating system, because all the data is 
stored in the cloud. Cloud-based operating systems require an Internet connection to access 
information. Android and Windows 10 use cloud storage but are not considered cloud-
based operating systems. Linux is strictly a workstation operating system. See Chapter 15 
for more information.
3. C. For privacy issues, Windows 10 Education does not include Cortana, since this edition 
is used for academic organizations. Windows 10 Home, Pro, and Enterprise all contain 
Cortana. See Chapter 15 for more information.
4. C. The System Properties applet ( sysdm.cpl ) allows you to change a computer’s name 
and join the system to a domain. Device Manager is used to manage hardware resources. 
The User Accounts applet is used to manage user accounts. Credential Manager is used to 
manage stored credentials. See Chapter 16 for more information.
5. B. The Microsoft Terminal Services Client ( mstsc ) is used to allow remote connections 
to Window operating systems. Msinfo32  is used to collect information from the Windows 
operating system. Msconfig  is used to configure startup and services. Telnet  is not used 
to connect to Windows; it is normally used with Linux/UNIX. See Chapter 16 for more 
information.
6. D. Striping with parity, also known as RAID-5, requires three or more disks and provides 
fault tolerance. Mirroring, also known as RAID-1, requires only two disks. Striping, also 
known as RAID-0, provides no fault tolerance. See Chapter 16 for more information.
7. B. Although Internet Explorer is still installed in Windows 10, the Edge browser has 
largely replaced it’s functionality in Windows 10. The Spotlight feature will display a 
random wallpaper on the login screen from Bing.com. Cortana is a digital person assistant. 
The Universal Windows Platform (UWP) is a development platform. See Chapter 17 for 
more information.
8. D. The Insider Program allows for the installation of brand new features before they are 
publically released. The Semi-Annual Channel is normally delayed by three to four months. 
The Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted) branch will install updates as they are released to the 
general public. The Long-Term Servicing Channel never installs new features during the life 
of the version of Windows. See Chapter 17 for more information.
9. B. The Action Center will allow you to see the status of both the UAC and Windows 
Activation. User Settings will show only the UAC status. Firewall with Advanced Security

xciv Answers to Assessment Test 220-1002
10. C .  The sysprep.exe  utility will allow you to ready the operating system for imaging, by 
resetting specific information, such as the computer name. The Microsoft Deployment 
Toolkit can assist in creating the steps, but it calls on the sysprep tool. The Windows 
Assessment and Deployment Kit allows you to customize the Windows operating system for 
imaging, but it does not ready the operating system for imaging. Windows Imaging (WIM) 
is a file format to contain the image. See Chapter 18 for more information.
11. D. The Boot Configuration Data (BCD) holds the information that instructs the  
Windows Boot Manager (bootmgr) to load the operating system from a specific partition.

18. A .  T he Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) operates on TCP port 3389. The SSH protocol 
operates on TCP port 22. The Telnet service operates on TCP port 23, and HTTPS operates 
on TCP port 443. See Chapter 21 for more information.
19. C. The line REM comment  is used to comment Windows batch script code. The line  
//comment  is used to comment JavaScript code. The line 'comment  is used to comment 
VBScript code. The line # comment  is used to comment Bash script code and PowerShell 
code. See Chapter 21 for more information.
20. A. A dictionary password attack occurs when a user account is repeatedly attacked using a 
variety of passwords. A rootkit attack would not be immediately seen and would not show 
as an ongoing effort. A worm attack would not be visible as an ongoing attempt to gain 
access. TCP/IP hijacking is a form of a man-in-the-middle attack. See Chapter 22 for more 
information.
21. A. A denial-of-service (DoS) attack is used to disrupt legitimate requests from being 
answered. A keylogger is used to steal credentials by recording keystrokes. A botnet is a 
group of computers that are under the control of a threat agent. Social engineering is a 
process in which an attacker attempts to acquire information about your network and 
system by social means, such as talking to people in the organization. See Chapter 22 for 
more information.
22. A. The acceptable use policy (AUP) defines the appropriate use of email and other 
organizational systems and resources. Mobile device management (MDM) helps an 
administrator control mobile devices so that data is not exposed. Data loss prevention 
(DLP) is used to prevent personal and confidential information from being emailed  
outside of the organization. Email filtering filters email coming into the organization. 
See Chapter 22 for more information.
23. B. Synchronization can copy all contacts, programs, email messages, pictures, music, 
and videos between a mobile device and a computer. Mirroring is a term reserved for 
when devices replicate themselves to similar devices. Calling the contacts won’t achieve 
the desired result, and emailing contacts is inefficient and does not immediately result in 
placing the contacts on the computer. See Chapter 23 for more information.
24. B. The .ipa  file extension is for iOS App Store package files. Android apps have an 
extension of .apk . The Windows Phone OS is typically associated with the .xap  extension. 
Blackberry OS uses .jad . The latter of the two phone types were not discussed in detail in 
this book. See Chapter 23 for more information.
25. A. Renaming the default accounts on a new Windows computer is the easiest way to 
secure the operating system. Configuring single sign-on should only be performed if  
a resource is required that only uses SSO as authentication. Disabling Windows Update 
will do the opposite of securing the operating system. Disabling Action Center pop-
ups will also do the opposite of securing the operating system. See Chapter 23 for 
more information.
26. C. Graphics cards usually require third-party tools to diagnosis performance problems. 
RAM problems, CPU problems, and network problems can be diagnosed inside the 
operating system from Task Manager. See Chapter 24 for more information.

xcvi Answers to Assessment Test 220-1002
27. C .  T he last step in the malware-removal process is the education of the end user to prevent 
future occurrences of infection. Identifying the malware is the first step in the malware-
removal process. Enabling System Protection is one of the last steps, but it is not the last 
step. Scheduling a scan should be performed after you have remediated the malware. See 
Chapter 24 for more information.
28. B. By using the 5 GHz wireless band, you can limit the amount of interference from 
external devices, such as microwave ovens and Bluetooth devices. Shortening the SSID 
will have no effect on intermittent signal drops, nor will reducing power on the WAP. 
Using the 2.4 GHz band will probably make signal drops worse. See Chapter 24 for more 
information.
29. C. You should text the user and let them know that you need to verify their network 
connection. You should not log in as another person, with their username and password. 
You should not log in and stay logged in when you are finished. You should definitely not 
log in and change the user’s password. See Chapter 25 for more information.
30. C. You should be honest and inform the customer of the situation. Explaining that the 
card was broken out of the box is untruthful and deceptive. Installing the card anyway will 
cause new problems. Leaving everything as-is until you can locate a new card does not help 
the customer, since you’ve created a new dilemma. See Chapter 25 for more information.
31. C. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) affects health-
care providers and providers that process health records. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) 
is enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and regulates sensitive 
financial information and financial records. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy 
Act (FERPA) affects education providers and organizations that process student records. 
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) affects providers of financial services and safeguards 
customer information. See Chapter 25 for more information.
32. B, D. Long hair or neckties can very easily hold a static charge and damage computer parts. 
In addition, if you don’t have an ESD strap or mat, you should perform self-grounding 
before you touch sensitive computer equipment. Lower humidity actually increases the risk 
of ESD. Taking off your shoes will not limit ESD. See Chapter 26 for more information.
33. D. A Torx screwdriver has a splined head, which is used for greater gripping of the screw. 
A flat-tipped screwdriver, as the name suggests, has a flat tip. A Phillips screwdriver has 
a cross, which is used for better gripping over a normal flat-tip screwdriver. An axial 
screwdriver is not a type of screwdriver. See Chapter 26 for more information.
34. B. Shareware often provides a free trial of a program, with the expectation that you will 
pay for it if you keep it. Freeware and open-source applications are generally totally free, 
although the developers may ask for donations. Single-user software is licensed for one 
user. See Chapter 26 for more information.
