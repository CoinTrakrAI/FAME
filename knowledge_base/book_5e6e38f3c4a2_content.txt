Introduction
If	you’re	preparing	to	take	the	Security+	exam,	you’ll	undoubtedly	want	to	find
as	much	information	as	you	can	about	computer	and	physical	security.	The	more
information	you	have	at	your	disposal	and	the	more	hands-on	experience	you
gain,	the	better	off	you’ll	be	when	attempting	the	exam.	This	study	guide	was
written	with	that	in	mind.	The	goal	was	to	provide	enough	information	to
prepare	you	for	the	test,	but	not	so	much	that	you’ll	be	overloaded	with
information	that’s	outside	the	scope	of	the	exam.
This	book	presents	the	material	at	an	intermediate	technical	level.	Experience
with	and	knowledge	of	security	concepts,	operating	systems,	and	application
systems	will	help	you	get	a	full	understanding	of	the	challenges	that	you’ll	face
as	a	security	professional.
We’ve	included	review	questions	at	the	end	of	each	chapter	to	give	you	a	taste	of
what	it’s	like	to	take	the	exam.	If	you’re	already	working	in	the	security	field,	we
recommend	that	you	check	out	these	questions	first	to	gauge	your	level	of
expertise.	You	can	then	use	the	book	mainly	to	fill	in	the	gaps	in	your	current
knowledge.	This	study	guide	will	help	you	round	out	your	knowledge	base
before	tackling	the	exam.
If	you	can	answer	90	percent	or	more	of	the	review	questions	correctly	for	a
given	chapter,	you	can	feel	safe	moving	on	to	the	next	chapter.	If	you’re	unable
to	answer	that	many	correctly,	reread	the	chapter	and	try	the	questions	again.
Your	score	should	improve.
 Don’t	just	study	the	questions	and	answers!	The	questions	on	the
actual	exam	will	be	different	from	the	practice	questions	included	in	this
book.	The	exam	is	designed	to	test	your	knowledge	of	a	concept	or
objective,	so	use	this	book	to	learn	the	objectives	behind	the	questions.

Before	You	Begin	the	CompTIA	Security+
Certification	Exam
Before	you	begin	studying	for	the	exam,	it’s	imperative	that	you	understand	a
few	things	about	the	Security+	certification.	Security+	is	a	certification	from
CompTIA	(an	industry	association	responsible	for	many	entry-level
certifications)	granted	to	those	who	obtain	a	passing	score	on	a	single	entry-level
exam.	In	addition	to	adding	Security+	to	your	résumé	as	a	stand-alone
certification,	you	can	use	it	as	an	elective	in	many	vendor-certification	tracks.
 The	CompTIA	Advance	Security	Practitioner	(CASP)
certification	is	designed	for	those	with	up	to	10	years	of	security	experience.
It	builds	on	Security+	and	authenticates	knowledge	at	a	higher	level.
Between	Security+	and	CASP,	CompTIA	created	a	Cybersecurity	Analyst
certification	(CSA+)	as	a	bridge	that	remains	vendor-neutral	and	verifies	that
successful	candidates	have	the	knowledge	and	skills	required	to	configure
and	use	threat	detection	tools,	perform	data	analysis,	and	interpret	the	results
to	identify	vulnerabilities,	threats,	and	risks	to	an	organization,	with	the	end
goal	of	securing	and	protecting	applications	and	systems	within	an
organization.
When	you’re	studying	for	any	exam,	the	first	step	in	preparation	should	always
be	to	find	out	as	much	as	possible	about	the	test:	the	more	you	know	up	front,
the	better	you	can	plan	your	course	of	study.	The	current	exam,	and	the	one
addressed	by	this	book,	is	the	2017	update.	Although	all	variables	are	subject	to
change,	as	this	book	is	being	written,	the	exam	consists	of	100	questions.	You
have	90	minutes	to	take	the	exam,	and	the	passing	score	is	based	on	a	scale	from
100	to	900.	Pearson	VUE	testing	centers	administer	the	exam	throughout	the
United	States	and	several	other	countries.
The	exam	is	predominantly	multiple	choice	with	short,	concise	questions,
usually	followed	by	four	possible	answers.	Don’t	expect	lengthy	scenarios	and
complex	solutions.	This	is	an	entry-level	exam	of	knowledge-level	topics;	you’re
expected	to	know	a	great	deal	about	security	topics	from	an	overview
perspective	rather	than	implementation.	In	many	books,	the	glossary	is	filler

added	to	the	back	of	the	text;	this	book’s	glossary	(located	on	the	book’s	online
test	bank	at	
www.wiley.com/go/sybextestprep
)	should	be	considered	necessary
reading.	You’re	likely	to	see	a	question	on	the	exam	about	what	a	Trojan	horse
is,	not	how	to	identify	it	at	the	code	level.	Spend	your	study	time	learning	the
different	security	solutions	and	identifying	potential	security	vulnerabilities	and
where	they	would	be	applicable.	Don’t	get	bogged	down	in	step-by-step	details;
those	are	saved	for	certification	exams	beyond	the	scope	of	Security+.
You	should	also	know	that	CompTIA	is	notorious	for	including	vague	questions
on	all	of	its	exams.	You	might	see	a	question	for	which	two	of	the	possible	four
answers	are	correct—but	you	can	choose	only	one.	Use	your	knowledge,	logic,
and	intuition	to	choose	the	best	answer	and	then	move	on.	Sometimes,	the
questions	are	worded	in	ways	that	would	make	English	majors	cringe—a	typo
here,	an	incorrect	verb	there.	Don’t	let	this	frustrate	you;	answer	the	question,
and	go	to	the	next.	Although	we	haven’t	intentionally	added	typos	or	other
grammatical	errors,	the	questions	throughout	this	book	make	every	attempt	to	re-
create	the	structure	and	appearance	of	the	real	exam	questions.
 CompTIA	frequently	does	what	is	called	
item	seeding
,	which	is
the	practice	of	including	unscored	questions	on	exams.	It	does	so	to	gather
psychometric	data,	which	is	then	used	when	developing	new	versions	of	the
exam.	Before	you	take	it,	you	are	told	that	your	exam	may	include	unscored
questions.	So,	if	you	come	across	a	question	that	does	not	appear	to	map	to
any	of	the	exam	objectives—or	for	that	matter,	does	not	appear	to	belong	in
the	exam—it	is	likely	a	seeded	question.	You	never	really	know	whether	or
not	a	question	is	seeded,	however,	so	always	make	your	best	effort	to	answer
every	question.
As	you	study,	you	need	to	know	that	the	exam	you’ll	take	was	created	at	a
certain	point	in	time.	You	won’t	see	a	question	about	the	new	virus	that	hit	your
systems	last	week,	but	you’ll	see	questions	about	concepts	that	existed	when	this
exam	was	created.	Updating	the	exam	is	a	difficult	process	and	results	in	an
increment	in	the	exam	number.

Why	Become	Security+	Certified?
There	are	a	number	of	reasons	for	obtaining	a	Security+	certification.	These
include	the	following:
It	provides	proof	of	professional	achievement.
	Specialized	certifications	are
the	best	way	to	stand	out	from	the	crowd.	In	this	age	of	technology	certifications,
you’ll	find	hundreds	of	thousands	of	administrators	who	have	successfully
completed	the	Microsoft	and	Cisco	certification	tracks.	To	set	yourself	apart
from	the	crowd,	you	need	a	little	bit	more.	The	Security+	exam	is	part	of	the
CompTIA	certification	track	that	includes	A+,	Network+,	and	other	vendor-
neutral	certifications	such	as	Linux+,	Project+,	and	more.	This	exam	will	help
you	prepare	for	more	advanced	certifications	because	it	provides	a	solid
grounding	in	security	concepts,	and	it	will	give	you	the	recognition	you	deserve.
It	increases	your	marketability.
	Almost	anyone	can	bluff	their	way	through	an
interview.	Once	you’re	Security+	certified,	you’ll	have	the	credentials	to	prove
your	competency.	Moreover,	certifications	can’t	be	taken	from	you	when	you
change	jobs—you	can	take	that	certification	with	you	to	any	position	you	accept.
It	provides	opportunity	for	advancement.
	Individuals	who	prove	themselves
to	be	competent	and	dedicated	are	the	ones	who	will	most	likely	be	promoted.
Becoming	certified	is	a	great	way	to	prove	your	skill	level	and	show	your
employer	that	you’re	committed	to	improving	your	skill	set.	Look	around	you	at
those	who	are	certified:	they	are	probably	the	people	who	receive	good	pay
raises	and	promotions.
It	fulfills	training	requirements.
	Many	companies	have	set	training
requirements	for	their	staff	so	that	they	stay	up-to-date	on	the	latest	technologies.
Having	a	certification	program	in	security	provides	administrators	with	another
certification	path	to	follow	when	they	have	exhausted	some	of	the	other
industry-standard	certifications.
It	raises	customer	confidence.
	As	companies	discover	the	advantages	of
CompTIA,	they	will	undoubtedly	require	qualified	staff	to	achieve	these
certifications.	Many	companies	outsource	their	work	to	consulting	firms	with
experience	working	with	security.	Firms	that	have	certified	staff	have	a	definite
advantage	over	firms	that	don’t.

How	to	Become	a	Security+	Certified
Professional
The	first	place	to	start	to	get	your	certification	is	to	register	for	the	exam	at	any
Pearson	VUE	testing	center.	Exam	pricing	might	vary	by	country	or	by
CompTIA	membership.	You	can	contact	Pearson	at:
Pearson	VUE
www.vue.com/comptia
U.S.	and	Canada:	877-551-PLUS	(7587)
When	you	schedule	the	exam,	you’ll	receive	instructions	regarding	appointment
and	cancellation	procedures,	ID	requirements,	and	information	about	the	testing
center	location.	In	addition,	you’ll	receive	a	registration	and	payment
confirmation	letter.	Exams	can	be	scheduled	up	to	six	weeks	out	or	as	late	as	the
next	day	(or,	in	some	cases,	even	on	the	same	day).
 Exam	prices	and	codes	may	vary	based	on	the	country	in	which
the	exam	is	administered.	For	detailed	pricing	and	exam	registration
procedures,	refer	to	CompTIA’s	website	at	
http://certification.comptia.org
.
After	you’ve	successfully	passed	your	Security+	exam,	CompTIA	will	award
you	a	certification.	Within	four	to	six	weeks	of	passing	the	exam,	you’ll	receive
your	official	CompTIA	Security+	certificate	and	ID	card.	(If	you	don’t	receive
these	within	eight	weeks	of	taking	the	test,	contact	CompTIA	directly	using	the
information	found	in	your	registration	packet.)

Who	Should	Read	This	Book?
If	you	want	to	acquire	a	solid	foundation	in	computer	security	and	your	goal	is	to
prepare	for	the	exam	by	learning	how	to	develop	and	improve	security,	this	book
is	for	you.	You’ll	find	clear	explanations	of	the	concepts	that	you	need	to	grasp
and	plenty	of	help	to	achieve	the	high	level	of	professional	competency	that	you
need	in	order	to	succeed	in	your	chosen	field.
If	you	want	to	become	certified	as	a	certification	holder,	this	book	is	definitely
what	you	need.	However,	if	you	just	want	to	attempt	to	pass	the	exam	without
really	understanding	security,	this	study	guide	isn’t	for	you.	It’s	written	for
people	who	want	to	acquire	hands-on	skills	and	in-depth	knowledge	of	computer
security.
 In	addition	to	reading	this	book,	you	might	consider	downloading
and	reading	the	white	papers	on	security	that	are	scattered	throughout	the
Internet.

What	Does	This	Book	Cover?
This	book	covers	everything	you	need	to	know	to	pass	the	Security+	exam.
Chapter	1	:	Managing	Risk
Chapter	2	:	Designing	and	Diagnosing	Networks
Chapter	3	:	Understanding	Devices	and	Infrastructure
Chapter	4	:	Identity	and	Access	Management
Chapter	5	:	Wireless	Network	Threats
Chapter	6	:	Securing	the	Cloud
Chapter	7	:	Data	and	Privacy	Security	Practices
Chapter	8	:	Cryptography
Chapter	9	:	Threats,	Attacks,	and	Vulnerabilities
Chapter	10	:	Social	Engineering	and	Other	Foes
Chapter	11	:	Security	Administration
Chapter	12	:	Disaster	Recovery	and	Incident	Response

Tips	for	Taking	the	Security+	Exam
Here	are	some	general	tips	for	taking	your	exam:
Bring	two	forms	of	ID	with	you.	One	must	be	a	photo	ID,	such	as	a	driver’s
license.	The	other	can	be	a	major	credit	card	or	a	passport.	Both	forms	must
include	a	signature.
Arrive	early	at	the	exam	center	so	that	you	can	relax	and	review	your	study
materials,	particularly	tables	and	lists	of	exam-related	information.	After
you	are	ready	to	enter	the	testing	room,	you	will	need	to	leave	everything
outside;	you	won’t	be	able	to	bring	any	materials	into	the	testing	area.
Read	the	questions	carefully.	Don’t	be	tempted	to	jump	to	an	early
conclusion.	Make	sure	that	you	know	exactly	what	each	question	is	asking.
Don’t	leave	any	unanswered	questions.	Unanswered	questions	are	scored
against	you.
There	will	be	questions	with	multiple	correct	responses.	When	there	is	more
than	one	correct	answer,	a	message	at	the	bottom	of	the	screen	will	prompt
you	to	either	“Choose	two”	or	“Choose	all	that	apply.”	Be	sure	to	read	the
messages	displayed	to	know	how	many	correct	answers	you	must	choose.
When	answering	multiple-choice	questions	about	which	you’re	unsure,	use
a	process	of	elimination	to	get	rid	of	the	obviously	incorrect	answers	first.
Doing	so	will	improve	your	odds	if	you	need	to	make	an	educated	guess.
On	form-based	tests	(nonadaptive),	because	the	hard	questions	will	take	the
most	time,	save	them	for	last.	You	can	move	forward	and	backward	through
the	exam.

How	to	Use	This	Book	and	Study	Tools
If	you	want	a	solid	foundation	for	preparing	for	the	Security+	exam,	this	is	the
book	for	you.	We’ve	spent	countless	hours	putting	together	this	book	with	the
sole	intention	of	helping	you	prepare	for	the	exam.
This	book	is	loaded	with	valuable	information,	and	you	will	get	the	most	out	of
your	study	time	if	you	understand	how	we	put	it	together.	Here’s	a	list	that
describes	how	to	approach	studying:
1
.	
Take	the	assessment	test	immediately	following	this	introduction.	It’s	okay
if	you	don’t	know	any	of	the	answers—that’s	what	this	book	is	for.
Carefully	read	over	the	explanations	for	any	question	that	you	get	wrong,
and	make	a	note	of	the	chapters	where	that	material	is	covered.
2
.	
Study	each	chapter	carefully,	making	sure	that	you	fully	understand	the
information	and	the	exam	objectives	listed	at	the	beginning	of	each	one.

Security+	exam,	and	they’re	really	great	study	tools.
6
.	
Take	the	practice	exams.
Performance-Based	Questions
CompTIA	introduced	performance-based	questions	in	their	certification
exams,	including	Security+,	several	years	ago.	These	are	not	the	traditional
multiple-choice	questions	with	which	you’re	probably	familiar.	These
questions	require	the	candidate	to	know	how	to	perform	a	specific	task	or

series	of	tasks.	Although	the	new	Security+	exam	was	not	live	by	the	time
this	book	was	published,	we	have	a	pretty	good	idea	of	how	these	questions
will	be	laid	out.	In	some	cases,	the	candidate	might	be	asked	to	fill	in	the
blank	with	the	best	answer.	Alternatively,	you	may	be	asked	to	match	certain
items	from	one	list	into	another.	Some	of	the	more	involved	performance-
based	questions	might	present	the	candidate	with	a	scenario	and	then	ask
them	to	complete	a	task.	You	will	be	taken	to	a	simulated	environment
where	you	will	have	to	perform	a	series	of	steps,	and	you	will	be	graded	on
how	well	you	complete	the	task.
The	Sybex	test	engine	does	not	have	the	ability	to	include	performance-
based	questions.	However,	we	have	included	numerous	hands-on	exercises
throughout	the	book	that	are	designed	to	measure	how	well	you	understand
the	chapter	topics.	Being	able	to	think	logically	is	a	great	way	to	learn.

Exam	SY0-501	Exam	Objectives
CompTIA	goes	to	great	lengths	to	ensure	that	its	certification	programs
accurately	reflect	the	IT	industry’s	best	practices.	They	do	this	by	establishing
committees	for	each	of	its	exam	programs.	Each	committee	comprises	a	small
group	of	IT	professionals,	training	providers,	and	publishers	who	are	responsible
for	establishing	the	exam’s	baseline	competency	level	and	who	determine	the
appropriate	target-audience	level.
Once	these	factors	are	determined,	CompTIA	shares	this	information	with	a
group	of	hand-selected	subject	matter	experts	(SMEs).	These	folks	are	the	true
brainpower	behind	the	certification	program.	In	the	case	of	this	exam,	they	are
IT-seasoned	pros	from	the	likes	of	Microsoft,	Oracle,	VeriSign,	and	RSA
Security,	to	name	just	a	few.	The	SMEs	review	the	committee’s	findings,	refine
them,	and	shape	them	into	the	objectives	that	follow	this	section.	CompTIA	calls
this	process	a	job-task	analysis	(JTA).
Finally,	CompTIA	conducts	a	survey	to	ensure	that	the	objectives	and	weightings
truly	reflect	job	requirements.	Only	then	can	the	SMEs	go	to	work	writing	the
hundreds	of	questions	needed	for	the	exam.	Even	so,	they	have	to	go	back	to	the
drawing	board	for	further	refinements	in	many	cases	before	the	exam	is	ready	to
go	live	in	its	final	state.	Rest	assured	that	the	content	you’re	about	to	learn	will
serve	you	long	after	you	take	the	exam.
 Exam	objectives	are	subject	to	change	at	any	time	without	prior
notice	and	at	CompTIA’s	sole	discretion.	Visit	the	certification	page	of
CompTIA’s	website	at	
http://certification.comptia.org
	for	the	most	current
listing	of	exam	objectives.
CompTIA	also	publishes	relative	weightings	for	each	of	the	exam’s	objectives.
The	following	table	lists	the	six	Security+	objective	domains	and	the	extent	to
which	they	are	represented	on	the	exam.	As	you	use	this	study	guide,	you’ll	find
that	we	have	administered	just	the	right	dosage	of	objective	knowledge	by
tailoring	coverage	to	mirror	the	percentages	that	CompTIA	uses.

excessive	bandwidth	is	used	in	the	network	as	a	result	of	the	requests.	For
more	information,	see	Chapter	3.

.	
B.	A	sensor	collects	data	from	the	data	source	and	passes	it	on	to	the
analyzer.	If	the	analyzer	determines	that	unusual	activity	has	occurred,	an
alert	may	be	generated.	For	additional	information,	see	Chapter	2.

.	
A.	An	SSID	(Service	Set	Identifier)	broadcast	includes	the	network	name.
For	additional	information	on	hardening,	see	Chapter	3.
12
.	
A.	To	meet	the	goal	of	integrity,	you	must	verify	that	the	information	being
used	is	accurate	and	hasn’t	been	tampered	with.	Integrity	is	coupled	with
accountability	to	ensure	that	data	is	accurate	and	that	a	final	authority	exists
to	verify	this,	if	needed.	For	more	information,	see	Chapter	8.
13
.	
D.	Online	Certificate	Status	Protocol	(OCSP)	is	the	mechanism	used	to
verify	immediately	whether	a	certificate	is	valid.	The	Certificate
Revocation	List	(CRL)	is	published	on	a	regular	basis,	but	it	isn’t	current
once	it’s	published.	For	additional	information,	see	Chapter	8.
14
.	
B.	TKIP	places	a	128-bit	wrapper	around	the	WEP	encryption	with	a	key
that	is	based	on	things	such	as	the	MAC	address	of	the	host	device	and	the
serial	number	of	the	packet.	For	additional	information,	see	Chapter	5.
15
.	
A.	IM	and	other	systems	allow	unsuspecting	users	to	download	files	that
may	contain	viruses.	Due	to	a	weakness	in	the	file	extension	naming
conventions,	a	file	that	appears	to	have	one	extension	may	actually	have
another	extension.	For	example,	the	file	
account.doc.vbs
	would	appear	in
many	applications	as	
account.doc
,	but	it’s	actually	a	Visual	Basic	script
and	could	contain	malicious	code.	For	additional	information,	see	Chapter
9.
16
.	
B.	Access	control	lists	(ACLs)	are	used	to	allow	or	deny	an	IP	address
access	to	a	network.	ACL	mechanisms	are	implemented	in	many	routers,
firewalls,	and	other	network	devices.	For	additional	information,	see
Chapter	3.
17
.	
B.	Virtualization	that	does	not	utilize	hypervisors	can	be	accomplished
through	the	use	of	containers,	also	known	as	“Docker	containers.”	For	more
information,	see	Chapter	6.
18
.	
D.	A	worm	is	designed	to	multiply	and	propagate.	Worms	may	carry	viruses
that	cause	system	destruction,	but	that	isn’t	their	primary	mission.	For	more
information,	see	Chapter	9.
19
.	
A.	Social	engineering	is	using	human	intelligence	methods	to	gain	access	or
information	about	your	organization.	For	additional	information,	see

Chapter	10.
20
.	
B.	A	man-in-the-browser	attack	(abbreviated	as	MITB,	MitB,	MIB,	and
MiB)	is	a	type	of	man-in-the-middle	attack	in	which	a	Trojan	horse
manipulates	calls	between	the	browser	and	its	security	mechanisms,
sniffing	or	modifying	transactions	as	they	are	formed	on	the	browser	yet
still	displaying	back	the	user’s	intended	transaction.	For	additional
information,	see	Chapter	9.
21
.	
A.	An	intrusion	prevention	system	(IPS)	provides	active	monitoring	and
rule-based	responses	to	unusual	activities	on	a	network.	A	firewall,	for
example,	provides	passive	security	by	preventing	access	from	unauthorized
traffic.	If	the	firewall	were	compromised,	the	IPS	would	notify	you	based
on	rules	that	it’s	designed	to	implement.	For	more	information,	see	Chapter
3.
22
.	
B.	The	chain	of	custody	ensures	that	each	step	taken	with	evidence	is
documented	and	accounted	for	from	the	point	of	collection.	Chain	of
custody	is	the	Who,	What,	When,	Where,	and	Why	of	evidence	storage.	For
additional	information,	see	Chapter	12.
23
.	
A.	Steganography	is	the	process	of	hiding	one	message	in	another.
Steganography	may	also	be	referred	to	as	electronic	watermarking.	For
additional	information,	see	Chapter	8.
24
.	
C.	Penetration/vulnerability	testing	that	takes	a	passive	approach	rather	than
actually	trying	to	break	into	the	network	is	known	as	nonintrusive	testing.
For	additional	information,	see	Chapter	12.
25
.	
B.	The	Key	Exchange	Algorithm	(KEA)	is	used	to	create	a	temporary
session	to	exchange	key	information.	This	session	creates	a	secret	key.
When	the	key	has	been	exchanged,	the	regular	session	begins.	For	more
information,	see	Chapter	8.
26
.	
A.	Elliptic	Curve	Cryptography	(ECC)	would	probably	be	your	best	choice.
ECC	is	designed	to	work	with	smaller	processors.	The	other	systems	may
be	options,	but	they	require	more	computing	power	than	ECC.	For
additional	information,	see	Chapter	8.
27
.	
B.	An	incremental	backup	will	generally	be	the	fastest	of	the	backup
methods	because	it	backs	up	only	the	files	that	have	changed	since	the	last
incremental	or	full	backup.	See	Chapter	12	for	more	information.
28
.	
C.	Biometrics	is	the	authentication	process	that	uses	physical

characteristics,	such	as	a	palm	print	or	retinal	pattern,	to	establish
identification.	For	more	information,	see	Chapter	11.

C.	Role-based	access	control	(RBAC)	is	primarily	concerned	with
providing	access	to	systems	that	a	user	needs	based	on	the	user’s	role	in	the
organization.	For	more	information,	see	Chapter	4.

.	
A.	Computer	forensics	is	the	process	of	investigating	a	computer	system	to
determine	the	cause	of	an	incident.	Part	of	this	process	would	be	gathering
evidence.	For	additional	information,	see	Chapter	12.

Change	management
 As	an	administrator,	you	are	responsible.	You	are
responsible	for	data	that	gets	created,	stored,	transmitted,	viewed,	modified,
deleted,	and	just	about	everything	else	that	can	be	done	with	it.	Because	of	this,
not	only	must	you	enable	it	to	exist,	but	you	must	protect	it,	authenticate	it,
secure	it,	and	keep	it	in	the	form	that	complies	with	every	applicable	law,	policy,
and	regulation.	Counter	to	this	are	all	of	the	dangers	that	can	befall	the	data:	it

can	be	accidentally	deleted,	overwritten,	stolen,	and	lost.	These	potential	harms
represent	
risks
,	and	you	must	know	the	risks	involved	in	working	with	data.	You
have	to	know	and	accept	that	data	can	be	corrupted,	it	can	be	accessed	by	those
who	shouldn’t	see	it,	values	can	be	changed,	and	so	on.
If	you	think	that	being	armed	with	this	knowledge	is	enough	to	drive	you	into
taking	the	steps	necessary	to	keep	any	harm	from	happening,	however,	you	are
sadly	mistaken.	One	of	the	actions	that	administrators	can	be	instructed	to	take
by	upper	management	regarding	potential	threats	is	to	accept	that	they	exist.	If
the	cost	of	preventing	a	particular	risk	from	becoming	a	reality	exceeds	the	value
of	the	harm	that	could	occur,	then	a	cost-benefit	risk	calculation	dictates	that	the
risk	should	stand.
Risk	calculations	weigh	a	potential	
threat
	against	the	
likelihood
	or	
probability
	of
it	occurring.	As	frustrating	as	it	may	seem,	you	should	accept	the	fact	that	some
risks,	often	called	
residual	risk
,	will	and	must	remain.	This	chapter	focuses	on
risk	and	the	various	ways	of	dealing	with	it,	all	of	which	you	will	need	to
understand	fully	in	order	to	succeed	on	the	Security+	exam.
We	will	start	out	by	looking	at	some	of	the	
vernacular
,	or	terms	associated	with
the	field	of	risk.	Then	we	will	move	into	risk	assessment;	policies,	standards,	and
guidelines;	and	change	management.

Risk	Terminology
Every	field	of	study	has	a	few	terms	or	words	that	are	unique	to	that	particular
field	in	order	to	help	those	in	the	profession	to	communicate	among	themselves.
The	study	of	risk	is	no	different.	A	number	of	terms	are	associated	with	risk	that
will	appear	at	various	places	in	this	chapter	and	throughout	the	book.	The
following	terms	(also	found	in	the	online	glossary)	are	those	that	CompTIA	is
fond	of	using	and	testing.	They	are	provided	in	order	to	make	it	easier	for	you	to
know	what	each	is	intended	to	convey.
Security+	Terminology
acceptable	use	policy/rules	of	behavior

organizations	that	own	and	operate	connected	IT	systems	to	document	the

technical	requirements	of	the	interconnection.	The	ISA	also	supports	a
Memorandum	of	Understanding	or	Agreement	(MOU/A)	between	the
organizations.”
maximum	tolerable	downtime	(MTD)

it	takes	a	system	or	component	to	fail.
mean	time	to	restore	(MTTR)
	The	measurement	of	how	long	it	takes	to
repair	a	system	or	component	once	a	failure	occurs.
memorandum	of	understanding	(MOU)/memorandum	of	agreement

document	between	two	or	more	parties	defining	their	respective
responsibilities	in	accomplishing	a	particular	goal	or	mission,	such	as
securing	a	system.

SLA.
single	loss	expectancy	(SLE)
	The	cost	of	a	single	loss	when	it	occurs.	This

single	point	of	failure	(SPOF)
	A	single	weakness	that	is	capable	of	bringing
an	entire	system	down
vulnerability
	A	flaw	or	weakness	in	some	part	of	a	system’s	security
procedures,	design,	implementation,	or	internal	controls	that	could	expose	it
to	danger	(accidental	or	intentional)	and	result	in	a	violation	of	the	security
policy.

Threat	Assessment
To	protect	your	resources,	you	need	to	be	able	to	identify	what	threats	to	them
exist—the	more	specific	you	can	be,	the	better.	It	is	easy	to	say	that	you	“might
lose	data,”	but	that	is	a	danger	as	opposed	to	a	threat.	The	
threat
	is	what	would
cause	you	to	lose	this	data.	In	general	terms,	a	
threat
	is	anything	that	can	harm
your	resources,	and	there	are	three	primary	categories	of	threats	that	need	to	be
identified	and	examined:
Environmental
	Threats	from	the	environment	include	things	such	as	floods,
tornados,	hurricanes,	and	so	on.	If	you	share	a	building	with	another
organization,	what	would	happen	if	a	fire	alarm	went	off	in	their	area?	Would
sprinklers	throughout	the	entire	building	be	activated	and	your	server	room
flooded?
Manmade
	There	can	be	overlap	between	the	categories,	and	the	environmental
flooding	of	a	server	room	could	be	manmade	in	nature,	caused	by	an	individual
holding	a	match	to	the	bathroom	smoke	detector.
Internal	vs.	External
	If	the	threat	is	an	individual	who	is	employed	by	your
organization,	then	it	is	considered	an	internal	threat.	If	the	individual	is	not
currently	employed	by	your	organization,	then	it	is	considered	an	external	threat.
One	graphical	tool	that	is	often	used	to	identify	threats	is	a	
risk	register
,	which	is
essentially	a	scatterplot	of	possible	problem	areas.	With	the	categories	of	threats
now	identified,	we	will	factor	them	into	an	assessment	of	risk	in	the	following
sections.

Risk	Assessment
Risk	assessment	is	also	known	as	
risk	analysis
	or	
risk	calculation
.	For	purposes
of	uniformity,	we	will	use	
risk	assessment
	as	the	term	of	choice	for	this
discussion.	
Risk	assessment
	deals	with	the	threats,	vulnerabilities,	and	impacts	of
a	loss	of	information-processing	capabilities	or	a	loss	of	information	itself.	In
simple	terms,	a	
vulnerability
	is	a	weakness	that	could	be	exploited	by	a	threat.
Each	risk	that	can	be	identified	should	be	outlined,	described,	and	evaluated	for
the	likelihood	of	it	occurring.	The	key	here	is	to	think	outside	the	box.
Conventional	threats	and	risks	are	often	too	limited	when	considering	risk
assessment.
The	chief	components	of	a	risk	assessment	process	are	outlined	here:
Risks	to	Which	the	Organization	Is	Exposed
	This	component	allows	you	to
develop	scenarios	that	can	help	you	evaluate	how	to	deal	with	these	types	of
risks	if	they	occur.	An	operating	system,	server,	or	application	may	have	known
risks	in	certain	environments.	You	should	create	a	plan	for	how	your
organization	will	best	deal	with	these	risks	and	the	best	way	for	it	to	respond	to
them.
Risks	That	Need	Addressing
	The	risk	assessment	component	also	allows	an
organization	to	provide	a	reality	check	on	which	risks	are	real	and	which	are
unlikely.	This	process	helps	an	organization	focus	on	its	resources	as	well	as	on
the	risks	that	are	most	likely	to	occur.	For	example,	industrial	espionage	and
theft	are	likely,	but	the	risk	of	a	hurricane	damaging	the	server	room	in	Indiana	is
very	low.	Therefore,	more	resources	should	be	allocated	to	prevent	espionage	or
theft	as	opposed	to	the	latter	possibility.
Coordination	with	BIA
	The	risk	assessment	component,	in	conjunction	with
the	
business	impact	analysis	(BIA)
,	provides	an	organization	with	an	accurate
picture	of	the	situation	facing	it.	It	allows	an	organization	to	make	intelligent
decisions	about	how	to	respond	to	various	scenarios.
 Conducting	a	Risk	Assessment

You’ve	been	asked	to	do	a	quick	assessment	of	the	risks	your	company	faces
from	a	security	perspective.	What	steps	might	you	take	to	develop	an
overview	of	your	company’s	problems?
1
.	
Interview	the	department	heads	and	the	data	owners	to	determine	what
information	they	believe	requires	additional	security	and	to	identify	the
existing	vulnerabilities	from	their	perspective.
2
.	
Evaluate	the	network	infrastructure	to	determine	known	vulnerabilities
and	how	you	might	counter	them.
3
.	
Perform	a	physical	assessment	of	the	facility	to	evaluate	what	physical
risks	must	be	countered.
Armed	with	this	information,	you	have	a	place	to	start,	and	you	can
determine	which	countermeasures	may	be	appropriate	for	the	company	to
mitigate	risk.
Computing	Risk	Assessment
When	you’re	doing	a	risk	assessment,	one	of	the	most	important	things	to	do	is
to	prioritize.	Not	everything	should	be	weighed	evenly,	because	some	events
have	a	greater	likelihood	of	happening.	In	addition,	a	company	can	accept	some
risks,	whereas	others	would	be	catastrophic	for	the	company.
 One	document	you	should	read	is	the	National	Institute	of
Standards	and	Technology	(NIST)	Guide	for	Conducting	Risk	Assessments,
Publication	800-30.	Revision	1	of	this	document	can	be	found	here:
http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-
30r1.pdf
It	is	worth	noting	that	the	revision	to	the	original	document	refocuses	it	from
being	primarily	just	about	risk	management	to	one	that	strongly	emphasizes
risk	assessment.
Risk	Calculations
For	purposes	of	risk	assessment,	both	in	the	real	world	and	for	the	exam,	you

should	familiarize	yourself	with	a	number	of	terms	to	determine	the	
impact
	an
event	could	have:
ALE
	is	the	
annual	loss	expectancy
	value.	This	is	a	monetary	measure	of
how	much	loss	you	could	expect	in	a	year.
SLE
	is	another	monetary	value,	and	it	represents	how	much	you	could
expect	to	lose	at	any	one	time:	the	
single	loss	expectancy
.	SLE	can	be
divided	into	two	components:
AV	(asset	value)
:	the	value	of	the	item
EF	(exposure	factor)
:	the	percentage	of	it	threatened
ARO
	is	the	likelihood,	often	drawn	from	historical	data,	of	an	event
occurring	within	a	year:	the	
annualized	rate	of	occurrence
.
When	you	compute	risk	assessment,	remember	this	formula:
SLE	×	ARO	=	ALE
As	an	example,	if	you	can	reasonably	expect	that	every	SLE,	which	is	equal	to
asset	value	(AV)	times	exposure	factor	(EF),	will	be	the	equivalent	of	$1,000	and
that	there	will	be	seven	such	occurrences	a	year	(ARO),	then	the	ALE	is	$7,000.
Conversely,	if	there	is	only	a	10	percent	chance	of	an	event	occurring	within	a
year	time	period	(ARO	=	0.1),	then	the	ALE	drops	to	$100.
In	Exercise	1.1,	we’ll	walk	through	some	risk	assessment	computations.
EXERCISE	1.1
Risk	Assessment	Computations
As	a	security	professional,	you	should	know	how	to	compute	SLE,	ALE,	and
ARO.	Given	any	two	of	the	numbers,	it’s	possible	to	calculate	the	third.	Here
are	three	scenarios	detailing	a	hypothetical	risk	assessment	situation
followed	by	the	details	for	figuring	out	the	ALE.	They	are	intended	to	give
you	experience	working	with	scenarios	similar	to	those	that	you	may	find	on
the	Security+	exam.	For	this	exercise,	compute	the	missing	values:
1
.	
You’re	the	administrator	of	a	web	server	that	generates	$25,000	per
hour	in	revenue.	The	probability	of	the	web	server	failing	during	the
year	is	estimated	to	be	25	percent.	A	failure	would	lead	to	three	hours

of	downtime	and	cost	$5,000	in	components	to	correct.	What	is	the
ALE?
The	SLE	is	$80,000	($25,000	×	3	hours	+	$5,000),	and	the	ARO	is
0.25.	Therefore,	the	ALE	is	$20,000	($80,000	×	0.25).
2
.	
You’re	the	administrator	for	a	research	firm	that	works	on	only	one
project	at	a	time	and	collects	data	through	the	web	to	a	single	server.
The	value	of	each	research	project	is	approximately	$100,000.	At	any
given	time,	an	intruder	could	commandeer	no	more	than	90	percent	of
the	data.	The	industry	average	for	ARO	is	0.33.	What	is	the	ALE?
The	SLE	equals	$90,000	($100,000	×	0.9),	and	the	ARO	is	0.33.
Therefore,	the	ALE	is	$29,700	($90,000	×	0.33).
3
.	
You	work	at	the	help	desk	for	a	small	company.	One	of	the	most
common	requests	to	which	you	must	respond	is	to	help	retrieve	a	file
that	has	been	accidentally	deleted	by	a	user.	On	average,	this	happens
once	a	week.	If	the	user	creates	the	file	and	then	deletes	it	on	the	server
(about	60	percent	of	the	incidents),	then	it	can	be	restored	in	moments
from	the	shadow	copy	and	there	is	rarely	any	data	lost.	If	the	user
creates	the	file	on	their	workstation	and	then	deletes	it	(about	40	percent
of	the	incidents),	and	if	it	can’t	be	recovered	and	it	takes	the	user	an
average	of	two	hours	to	re-create	it	at	$12	an	hour,	what	is	the	ALE?
The	SLE	is	$24	($12	×	2),	and	the	ARO	is	20.8	(52	weeks	×	0.4).
Therefore,	the	ALE	equals	$499.20	($24	×	20.8).
Key	to	any	risk	assessment	is	identifying	both	assets	and	threats.	You	first	have
to	identify	what	it	is	that	you	want	to	protect	and	then	what	possible	harm	could
come	to	those	assets.	You	then	analyze	the	risks	in	terms	of	either	cost	or
severity.
Quantitative	vs.	Qualitative	Risk	Assessment
Risk	assessment	can	be	either	
qualitative
	(opinion-based	and	subjective)	or
quantitative
	(cost-based	and	objective),	depending	on	whether	you	are	focusing
on	dollar	amounts	or	simply	downtime.	The	formulas	for	single	loss	expectancy
(SLE),	annual	loss	expectancy	(ALE),	and	annualized	rate	of	occurrence	(ARO)
are	all	based	on	doing	assessments	that	lead	to	dollar	amounts	and	are	thus
quantitative.

To	understand	the	difference	between	quantitative	and	qualitative,	it	helps	to	use
a	simple	example.	Imagine	that	you	get	an	emergency	call	to	help	a	small
company	that	you	have	never	heard	from	before.	It	turns	out	that	their	one	and
only	server	has	crashed	and	that	their	backups	are	useless.	One	of	the	lost	files
was	the	only	copy	of	the	company’s	history.	This	file	detailed	the	company	from
the	day	it	began	to	the	present	day	and	had	the	various	iterations	of	the	mission
statement	as	it	changed	over	time.	As	painful	a	loss	as	this	file	represents	to	the
company’s	culture,	it	has	nothing	to	do	with	filling	orders	and	keeping	customers
happy,	and	thus	its	loss	is	qualitative	in	nature.
Another	loss	was	the	customer	database.	This	held	customer	contact	information
as	well	as	the	history	of	all	past	orders,	charge	numbers,	and	so	on.	The	company
cannot	function	without	this	file,	and	it	needs	to	be	re-created	by	pulling	all	of
the	hard	copy	invoices	from	storage	and	re-entering	them	into	the	system.	This
loss	can	be	calculated	by	the	amount	of	business	lost	and	the	amount	of	time	it
takes	to	find/re-enter	all	of	the	data,	and	thus	it	is	a	quantitative	loss.
 Whenever	you	see	the	word	
quantitative
,	think	of	the	goal	as
determining	a	dollar	amount.	Whenever	you	see	the	word	
qualitative
,	think
of	a	best	guess	or	opinion	of	the	loss,	including	reputation,	goodwill,	and
irreplaceable	information;	pictures;	or	data	that	get	you	to	a	subjective	loss
amount.
Risk	Measurements
Make	sure	that	you	understand	the	scope	and	terms	of	hardware	and	
service-
level	agreement	(SLA)
–related	terms.	Doing	so	can	help	avoid	frustration	and
prevent	unanticipated	disruptions	from	crippling	your	organization.	The
following	are	key	measures	with	which	you	should	be	familiar:
Likelihood
	The	meaning	of	the	word	
likelihood
	is	usually	self-explanatory;
however,	actual	values	can	be	assigned	to	likelihood.	The	National	Institute	of
Standards	and	Technology	recommends	viewing	likelihood	as	a	score
representing	the	possibility	of	threat	initiation.	In	this	way,	it	can	be	expressed
either	in	qualitative	or	quantitative	terms.

A	
supply	chain	assessment
	is	similarly	used	to	look	at	the	vendors	your
organization	works	with	strategically	and	the	potential	risks	they	introduce.
Threat	Vectors
	The	term	
threat	vector
	is	the	way	in	which	an	attacker	poses	a
threat.	This	can	be	a	particular	tool	that	they	can	use	against	you	(a	vulnerability
scanner,	for	example)	or	the	path(s)	of	attack	that	they	follow.	Under	that	broad
definition,	a	threat	vector	can	be	anything	from	a	fake	email	that	lures	you	into
clicking	a	link	(phishing)	or	an	unsecured	hotspot	(rouge	access	point)	and
everything	in	between.
Mean	Time	Between	Failures
	The	
mean	time	between	failures	(MTBF)
	is	the
measure	of	the	anticipated	incidence	of	failure	for	a	system	or	component.	This
measurement	determines	the	component’s	anticipated	lifetime.	If	the	MTBF	of	a
cooling	system	is	one	year,	you	can	anticipate	that	the	system	will	last	for	a	one-
year	period;	this	means	that	you	should	be	prepared	to	replace	or	rebuild	the
system	once	a	year.	If	the	system	lasts	longer	than	the	MTBF,	it’s	a	bonus	for
your	organization.	MTBF	is	helpful	in	evaluating	a	system’s	reliability	and	life
expectancy.
Mean	Time	to	Failure
	Similar	to	MTBF,	the	
mean	time	to	failure	(MTTF)
	is	the
average	time	to	failure	for	a	nonrepairable	system.	If	the	system	can	be	repaired,
the	MTBF	is	the	measurement	to	focus	on,	but	if	it	cannot,	then	MTTF	is	the
number	to	examine.	Sometimes,	MTTF	is	improperly	used	in	place	of	MTBF,

but	as	an	administrator	you	should	know	the	difference	between	them	and	when
to	use	one	measurement	or	the	other.
Mean	Time	to	Restore
	The	
mean	time	to	restore	(MTTR
)
	is	the	measurement	of
how	long	it	takes	to	repair	a	system	or	component	once	a	failure	occurs.	(This	is
often	also	referenced	as	
mean	time	to	repair.
)	In	the	case	of	a	computer	system,
if	the	MTTR	is	24	hours,	this	tells	you	that	it	will	typically	take	24	hours	to
repair	it	when	it	breaks.
 Although	MTTR	is	considered	a	common	measure	of
maintainability,	be	careful	when	evaluating	it	because	it	doesn’t	typically
include	the	time	needed	to	acquire	a	component	and	have	it	shipped	to	your
location.	This	author	(Emmett	Dulaney)	once	worked	with	a	national	vendor
who	thought	MTTR	meant	mean	time	to	respond—that	is,	a	technician
would	show	up	on	site	within	the	time	called	for	in	the	contract,	but	would
only	then	begin	to	look	at	the	problem	and	make	a	list	of	any	needed
supplies.	Make	sure	that	the	contract	or	service-level	agreement	spells	out
exactly	what	you	want.
Recovery	Time	Objective
	The	
recovery	time	objective	(RTO)
	is	the	maximum
amount	of	time	that	a	process	or	service	is	allowed	to	be	down	and	the
consequences	still	to	be	considered	acceptable.	Beyond	this	time,	the	break	in
business	continuity	is	considered	to	affect	the	business	negatively.	The	RTO	is
agreed	on	during	BIA	creation.
Recovery	Point	Objective
	The	
recovery	point	objective	(RPO)
	is	similar	to
RTO,	but	it	defines	the	point	at	which	the	system	needs	to	be	restored.	This
could	be	where	the	system	was	two	days	before	it	crashed	(whip	out	the	old
backup	tapes)	or	five	minutes	before	it	crashed	(requiring	complete	redundancy).
As	a	general	rule,	the	closer	the	RPO	matches	the	item	of	the	crash,	the	more
expensive	it	is	to	obtain.
Most	SLAs	that	relate	to	risk	management	stipulate	the	definitions	of	these	terms
and	how	they	apply	to	the	agreement.	You	should	understand	how	these	terms
are	used	and	what	they	mean	to	the	vendor	and	to	your	organization	in	order	to
ensure	that	there	is	concurrence.
Assessing	Privacy

One	area	of	primary	importance	for	administrators	today	is	privacy.	Not	only	are
you	charged	with	keeping	data	accessible,	but	that	accessibility	must	be	limited
to	certain	parties,	and	those	parties	seem	to	change	on	a	regular	basis.	In
healthcare,	for	example,	records	may	be	limited	to	only	a	patient	and	a	doctor,
but	one	patient	may	have	a	dozen	doctors	and	all	of	those	doctors	need	to	see
that	data.	Other	patients	will	want	their	spouse	to	be	able	to	access	their	records,
while	still	others	won’t.	And	so	it	goes…
Two	privacy-related	concepts	with	which	you	should	be	familiar	are	the	
privacy
impact	assessment	(PIA)
	and	
privacy	threshold	assessment	(PTA)
.	A	PIA	is	often
associated	with	a	business	impact	analysis,	and	it	identifies	the	adverse	impacts
that	can	be	associated	with	the	destruction,	corruption,	or	loss	of	accountability
of	data	for	the	organization.	The	Department	of	Homeland	Security	(DHS),	for
example,	uses	it	to	identify	and	mitigate	privacy	risks	by	telling	the	public	what
personally	identifiable	information	(PII)
	it	collects,	why	it	is	collected,	and	how
it	is	used,	accessed,	shared,	safeguarded,	and	stored.	According	to	the	DHS,	a
PIA	needs	to	do	three	things:	ensure	conformance	with	applicable	legal,
regulatory,	and	policy	requirements	for	privacy;	determine	risks	and	effects;	and
evaluate	protections	and	alternative	processes	to	mitigate	potential	privacy	risks.
A	PTA,	on	the	other	hand,	is	more	commonly	known	as	an	“analysis”	rather	than
an	“assessment.”	This	is	the	compliance	tool	used	in	conjunction	with	the	PIA.
An	example	of	the	form	the	DHS	uses	for	this	purpose	can	be	found	at
https://www.dhs.gov/compliance
.
Two	types	of	testing	that	can	help	identify	risks	are	
penetration	testing
	and
vulnerability	testing
.	They	are	particularly	useful	with	identifying	threats
associated	with	authorization.	Both	are	discussed	in	more	detail	in	subsequent
chapters.
Acting	on	Your	Risk	Assessment
Once	you’ve	identified	and	assessed	the	risks	that	exist,	for	the	purpose	of	the
exam,	you	have	four	possible	responses	that	you	can	choose	to	follow:
Risk	Avoidance
	
Risk	avoidance
	involves	identifying	a	risk	and	making	the
decision	not	to	engage	any	longer	in	the	actions	associated	with	that	risk.	For
example,	a	company	may	decide	that	many	risks	are	associated	with	email
attachments,	and	it	may	choose	to	forbid	any	email	attachments	from	entering
the	network.	As	part	of	risk	avoidance,	the	company	takes	steps	to	remove	the
risk,	chooses	to	engage	in	some	other	activity,	or	puts	a	stop	to	their	exposure	to

the	risk.	Avoidance	should	be	based	on	an	informed	decision	that	the	best	course
of	action	is	to	deviate	from	what	could	lead	to	exposure	to	the	risk.	One	of	the
biggest	problems	with	risk	avoidance	is	that	you	are	actually	steering	clear	of
activities	from	which	you	may	benefit.	The	most	effective	risk	avoidance
strategy	to	avoid	computer	crime,	for	example,	would	simply	be	to	avoid	using
computers	at	all.	Not	only	is	that	solution	impractical,	but	it	would	also	prevent
companies	from	adding	social	value	(not	to	mention	monetary	value)	for	their
stakeholders.
Risk	Transference
	
Risk	transference
,	contrary	to	what	the	name	may	imply,
does	not	mean	that	you	shift	the	risk	completely	to	another	entity.	What	you	do
instead	is	share	some	of	the	burden	of	the	risk	with	someone	else,	such	as	an
insurance	company.	A	typical	policy	would	pay	you	a	cash	amount	if	all	the
steps	were	in	place	to	reduce	risk	and	your	system	was	still	harmed.
The	current	push	is	to	move	many	services	to	the	cloud,	hosted	by	a	third-party
provider.	If	you	do	so,	you	are	engaging	in	a	form	of	risk	transference	by	relying
on	that	third-party	provider	for	uptime,	performance,	and	security	measures.
Another	risk	transference	possibility	involves	employing	external	consultants	for
assistance	with	solutions	in	areas	where	internal	IT	is	weak	and	requiring	the
external	consultants	to	guarantee	their	work.
Risk	Mitigation
	
Risk	mitigation
	is	accomplished	any	time	you	take	steps	to
reduce	risk.	This	category	includes	installing	antivirus	software,	educating	users
about	possible	threats,	monitoring	network	traffic,	adding	a	firewall,	and	so	on.
In	Microsoft’s	Security	Intelligence	Report,	Volume	13,	the	following
suggestions	for	mitigating	risk	through	user	awareness	training	are	listed:
Keep	security	messages	fresh	and	in	circulation.
Target	new	employees	and	current	staff	members.
Set	goals	to	ensure	that	a	high	percentage	of	the	staff	is	trained	on	security
best	practices.
Repeat	the	information	to	raise	awareness.
CompTIA	is	fond	of	risk	mitigation	and	confronting	it	through	the	use	of	routine
audits
	that	address	
user	rights
	and	
permission	reviews
;	
change	management
,	the
structured	approach	that	is	followed	to	secure	a	company’s	assets;	and	
incident
management
,	the	steps	followed	when	events	occur	(making	sure	that	controls
are	in	place	in	order	to	prevent	unauthorized	access	to,	and	changes	of,	all	IT
assets).	Policies	addressing	data	loss	or	theft	need	to	be	in	place,	and	technology

controls	should	be	enforced.
Data	loss	prevention	(DLP)
	systems	monitor	the	contents	of	systems
(workstations,	servers,	and	networks)	to	make	sure	that	key	content	is	not
deleted	or	removed.	They	also	monitor	who	is	using	the	data	(looking	for
unauthorized	access)	and	transmitting	the	data.	DLP	systems	share	commonality
with	network	intrusion	prevention	systems.	Other	approaches	include	IPSs,
firewalls,	and	similar	devices	that	can	help	mitigate	risk.
Risk	Acceptance
	
Risk	acceptance
	is	often	the	choice	that	you	must	make	when
the	cost	of	implementing	any	of	the	other	responses	exceeds	the	value	of	the
harm	that	would	occur	if	the	risk	came	to	fruition.	To	truly	qualify	as	acceptance,
it	cannot	be	a	risk	where	the	administrator	or	manager	is	unaware	of	its
existence;	it	has	to	be	an	identified	risk	for	which	those	involved	understand	the
potential	cost	or	damage	and	agree	to	accept	it.	
Risk	acceptance
	is	nothing	more
than	acknowledging	that	a	risk	exists	and	choosing	to	do	nothing	about	it.	It	does
not	necessarily	mean	that	you	will	be	affected	by	the	risk,	but	only	that	you
realize	that	such	a	possibility	exists.	Quite	often,	this	is	the	choice	that	you	make
when	the	cost	of	implementing	any	of	the	other	options	exceeds	the	value	of	any
harm	that	could	occur	if	the	risk	is	realized.	Every	firm	has	a	different	level	of
risk	tolerance
	(sometimes	called	a	
risk	appetite
)	that	they	are	willing	to	accept.
Risk	strategies	need	not	be	thought	of	as	either/or	propositions.	It	is	often
possible	to	combine	a	bit	of	mitigation	with	avoidance.	You	will	often	try	to
combine	strategies	to	reduce	your	exposure	as	much	as	possible.	You	are	then
left	to	accept	those	issues	that	cannot	be	addressed	otherwise.	In	the	case	of	the
mailbox	analogy,	the	approach	of	grouping	individual	boxes	together	and
placing	them	all	in	stone	combines	elements	of	both	mitigation	and	transference.
Often	you	can	create	interesting	or	memorable	examples	to	help	in
understanding	or	memorizing	various	lists.	This	works	well	for	the	possible	risk
responses,	too.
Imagine	that	you	are	a	junior	administrator	for	a	large	IT	department,	and	you
believe	that	one	of	the	older	servers	should	be	replaced	with	a	new	one.	There
are	no	signs	of	failure	now,	but	you	believe	it	would	be	prudent	to	upgrade
before	anything	disastrous	happens.	The	problem,	however,	is	that	all	spending
requires	approval	from	your	superior,	who	is	focused	on	saving	the	company	as
much	money	as	possible	and,	by	doing	so,	hopes	to	be	considered	for	a
promotion.	Thus,	she	does	not	want	anyone	coming	up	with	ways	to	spend
money	unnecessarily.	You	know	her	well	enough	to	realize	that	if	a	problem

does	occur,	she	will	not	hesitate	to	put	all	the	blame	on	you	in	order	to	save	her
own	career.	
Table	1.2
	shows	how	you	would	apply	each	of	the	possible	risk
actions	to	this	scenario.
TABLE	1.2
	Risk	actions	for	the	scenario
Risk	action
Application
Risk
avoidance
You	begin	moving	services	from	the	older	server	to	other	servers
and	remove	the	load	to	avoid	the	risk	of	any	services	being
affected	by	its	demise.
Risk
transference
You	write	up	the	possibility	of	the	server	failing	along	with	details
of	what	you	think	should	be	done	to	prevent	it,	and	you	submit
your	findings	to	your	boss	while	keeping	a	copy	for	yourself.	If	the
server	does	fail,	you	have	proof	that	you	documented	this
possibility	and	made	the	appropriate	parties	aware	of	the	situation.
Risk
mitigation
You	write	up	the	possibility	of	failure	and	submit	it	to	your	boss
while	also	moving	crucial	services	from	that	server	to	others.
Risk
acceptance
You	know	the	server	could	fail	but	hope	that	it	doesn’t.	You
neither	write	nor	submit	reports	because	you	don’t	want	to	rock
the	boat	and	make	your	boss	unhappy	with	you.	With	luck,	you’ll
have	transferred	to	another	division	before	the	server	ever	goes
down.
Risk	transference,	mitigation,	and	avoidance	are	all	proactive	solutions	that
require	planning	and	implementation	ahead	of	time.	Risk	acceptance,	on	the
other	hand,	merely	adopts	a	“do	nothing”	approach.	These	constitute	the	four
response	strategies	that	CompTIA	expects	you	to	know	for	the	risk	management
portion	of	the	Security+	exam.
Risks	Associated	with	Cloud	Computing
The	term	
cloud	computing
	has	grown	in	popularity	recently,	but	few	agree	on
what	it	truly	means.	For	the	purpose	of	the	Security+	exam,	
cloud	computing
means	hosting	services	and	data	on	the	Internet	instead	of	hosting	it	locally.
Some	examples	of	this	include	running	office	suite	applications	such	as	Office
365	or	Google	Docs	from	the	web	instead	of	having	similar	applications
installed	on	each	workstation;	storing	data	on	server	space,	such	as	Google
Drive,	SkyDrive,	or	Amazon	Web	Services;	and	using	cloud-based	sites	such	as
Salesforce.com
.

From	an	exam	standpoint,	there	are	three	different	ways	of	implementing	cloud
computing:
Platform	as	a	Service
	The	
Platform	as	a	Service	(PaaS)
	model	is	also	known	as
cloud	platform	services
.	In	this	model,	vendors	allow	apps	to	be	created	and	run
on	their	infrastructure.	Two	well-known	models	of	this	implementation	are
Amazon	Web	Services	and	Google	Code.
Software	as	a	Service
	The	
Software	as	a	Service	(SaaS)
	model	is	the	one	often
thought	of	when	users	generically	think	of	cloud	computing.	In	this	model,
applications	are	remotely	run	over	the	web.	The	big	advantages	are	that	no	local
hardware	is	required	(other	than	that	needed	to	obtain	web	access)	and	no
software	applications	need	to	be	installed	on	the	machine	accessing	the	site.	The
best-known	model	of	this	type	is	
Salesforce.com
.	Costs	are	usually	computed	on
a	subscription	basis.
Infrastructure	as	a	Service
	The	
Infrastructure	as	a	Service	(IaaS)
	model
utilizes	virtualization,	and	clients	pay	a	cloud	service	provider	for	resources
used.	Because	of	this,	the	IaaS	model	closely	resembles	the	traditional	utility
model	used	by	electric,	gas,	and	water	providers.	GoGrid	is	a	well-known
example	of	this	implementation.
A	number	of	organizations	have	examined	risk-related	issues	associated	with
cloud	computing.	These	issues	include	the	following:
Regulatory	Compliance
	Depending	on	the	type	and	size	of	your	organization,
there	are	any	number	of	regulatory	agencies’	rules	with	which	you	must	comply.
If	your	organization	is	publicly	traded,	for	example,	you	must	adhere	to
Sarbanes-Oxley’s	demanding	and	exacting	rules,	which	can	be	difficult	to	do
when	the	data	is	not	located	on	your	servers.	Make	sure	that	whoever	hosts	your
data	takes	privacy	and	security	as	seriously	as	you	do.
User	Privileges
	Enforcing	user	privileges	can	be	fairly	taxing.	If	the	user	does
not	have	least	privileges	(addressed	later	in	this	chapter),	then	their	escalated
privileges	could	allow	them	to	access	data	to	which	they	would	not	otherwise
have	access	and	cause	harm	to	it—intentional	or	not.	Be	cognizant	of	the	fact
that	you	won’t	have	the	same	control	over	user	accounts	in	the	cloud	as	you	do
locally,	and	when	someone	locks	their	account	by	entering	the	wrong	password
too	many	times	in	a	row,	you	or	they	could	be	at	the	mercy	of	the	hours	that	the
technical	staff	is	available	at	the	provider.
Data	Integration/Segregation
	Just	as	web-hosting	companies	usually	put	more
than	one	company’s	website	on	a	server	in	order	to	be	profitable,	data-hosting

companies	can	put	more	than	one	company’s	data	on	a	server.	To	keep	this	from
being	problematic,	you	should	use	encryption	to	protect	your	data.	Be	aware	of
the	fact	that	your	data	is	only	as	safe	as	the	data	with	which	it	is	integrated.	For
example,	assume	that	your	client	database	is	hosted	on	a	server	that	another
company	is	also	using	to	test	an	application	that	they	are	creating.	If	their
application	obtains	root-level	access	at	some	point	(such	as	to	change
passwords)	and	crashes	at	that	point,	then	the	user	running	the	application	could
be	left	with	root	permissions	and	conceivably	be	able	to	access	data	on	the	server
for	which	they	are	not	authorized,	such	as	your	client	database.	Data	segregation
is	crucial;	keep	your	data	on	secure	servers.
Data	integration	is	equally	important.	Make	sure	that	your	data	is	not	comingled
beyond	your	expectations.	It	is	not	uncommon	in	an	extranet	to	pull	information
from	a	number	of	databases	in	order	to	create	a	report.	Those	databases	can	be
owned	by	anyone	connected	to	the	extranet,	and	it	is	important	to	make	certain
that	the	permissions	on	your	databases	are	set	properly	to	keep	other	members
from	accessing	more	information	than	you	intended	to	share.
 Among	the	groups	focused	on	cloud	security	issues,	one	worth
noting	is	the	Cloud	Security	Alliance	(
https://cloudsecurityalliance.org
).
They	have	published	a	number	of	whitepapers	on	security-related	issues	that
can	be	found	on	their	site	and	should	be	considered	highly	recommended
reading	for	security	administrators.
Risks	Associated	with	Virtualization
If	cloud	computing	has	grown	in	popularity,	
virtualization
	has	become	the
technology	du	jour.	Virtualization	consists	of	allowing	one	set	of	hardware	to
host	multiple	virtual	machines.	It	is	in	use	at	most	large	corporations,	and	it	is
also	becoming	more	common	at	smaller	businesses.
Some	of	the	possible	security	risks	associated	with	virtualization	include	the
following:
Breaking	Out	of	the	Virtual	Machine
	If	a	disgruntled	employee	could	break
out	of	the	virtualization	layer	and	were	able	to	access	the	other	virtual	machines,
they	could	access	data	that	they	should	never	be	able	to	access.

Intermingling	Network	and	Security	Controls
	The	tools	used	to	administer
the	virtual	machine	may	not	have	the	same	granularity	as	those	used	to	manage
the	network.	This	could	lead	to	privilege	escalation	and	a	compromise	of
security.
Most	virtualization-specific	threats	focus	on	the	hypervisor.	
Hypervisor
	is	the
virtual	machine	monitor—that	is,	the	software	that	allows	the	virtual	machines	to
exist.	If	the	hypervisor	can	be	successfully	attacked,	the	attacker	can	gain	root-
level	access	to	all	virtual	systems.	Although	this	is	a	legitimate	issue,	and	one
that	has	been	demonstrated	as	possible	in	most	systems	(including	VMware,
Xen,	and	Microsoft	Virtual	Machine),	it	is	one	that	has	been	patched	each	time	it
has	arisen.	The	solution	to	most	virtualization	threats	is	always	to	apply	the	most
recent	patches	and	keep	the	system(s)	up	to	date.	Be	sure	to	look	for	and
implement	suggestions	that	the	vendor	of	your	virtualization	system	may	have
published	in	a	hardening	guide.

Developing	Policies,	Standards,	and	Guidelines
The	process	of	implementing	and	maintaining	a	secure	network	must	first	be
addressed	from	a	policies,	standards,	and	guidelines	perspective.	This	sets	the
tone,	provides	authority,	and	gives	your	efforts	the	teeth	they	need	to	be
effective.	Policies	and	guidelines	set	a	standard	of	expectation	in	an
organization.	The	process	of	developing	these	policies	will	help	everyone	in	an
organization	become	involved	and	invested	in	making	security	efforts	successful.
You	can	think	of	policies	as	providing	high-level	guidance	on	large	issues.
Standards	tell	people	what	is	expected,	and	guidelines	provide	specific	advice	on
how	to	accomplish	a	given	task	or	activity.
 There	is	a	difference	between	“top-down	policies”	(those	that	use
the	support	of	upper	management)	and	“bottom-up	policies”	(often
generated	by	the	IT	department	with	little	intradepartmental	support).
The	following	sections	discuss	the	policies,	standards,	and	guidelines	that	you’ll
need	to	establish	in	order	for	your	security	efforts	to	be	successful.
Implementing	Policies
Policies
	provide	the	people	in	an	organization	with	guidance	about	their
expected	behavior.	Well-written	policies	are	clear	and	concise,	and	they	outline
the	consequences	when	they	aren’t	followed.	A	good	policy	contains	several	key
areas	besides	the	policy	itself.
Scope	Statement
	A	good	policy	has	a	
scope	statement
	that	outlines	what	the
policy	intends	to	accomplish	and	which	documents,	laws,	and	practices	the
policy	addresses.	The	scope	statement	provides	background	to	help	readers
understand	what	the	policy	is	about	and	how	it	applies	to	them.
 The	scope	statement	is	always	brief—usually	not	more	than	a
single	sentence	in	length.

Policy	Overview	Statement
	A	
policy	overview	statement
	provides	the	goal	of
the	policy,	why	it’s	important,	and	how	to	comply	with	it.	Ideally,	a	single
paragraph	is	all	you	need	to	provide	readers	with	a	sense	of	the	policy.
Policy	Statement
	Once	the	policy’s	readers	understand	its	importance,	they
should	be	informed	about	the	substance	of	the	policy.	A	
policy	statement
	should
be	as	clear	and	unambiguous	as	possible.	The	policy	may	be	presented	in
paragraph	form,	as	bulleted	lists,	or	as	checklists.
The	presentation	will	depend	on	the	policy’s	target	audience	as	well	as	its	nature.
If	the	policy	is	intended	to	help	people	determine	how	to	lock	up	the	building	at
the	end	of	the	business	day,	for	example,	it	might	be	helpful	to	provide	a	specific
checklist	of	the	steps	that	need	to	be	taken	to	accomplish	this	task.
Accountability	Statement
	This	policy	should	address	who	(usually	expressed
as	a	position,	not	the	actual	name	of	an	individual)	is	responsible	for	ensuring
that	the	policy	is	enforced.	The	
accountability	statement
	provides	additional
information	to	the	reader	about	who	to	contact	if	a	problem	is	discovered.	It
should	also	indicate	the	consequences	of	not	complying	with	the	policy.
 The	accountability	statement	should	be	written	in	such	a	way	as
to	leave	no	room	for	misinterpretation	on	the	part	of	users.
Exception	Statement
	Sometimes,	even	the	best	policy	doesn’t	foresee	every
eventuality.	The	
exception	statement
	provides	specific	guidance	about	the
procedure	or	process	that	must	be	followed	in	order	to	deviate	from	the	policy.
This	may	include	an	escalation	contact	in	the	event	that	the	person	who	is
dealing	with	the	situation	needs	to	know	whom	to	contact	next.
The	policy	development	process	is	often	time-consuming.	The	advantage	of	this
process,	though,	is	that	the	decisions	can	be	made	in	advance	and	can	be	sent	to
all	involved	parties	so	that	the	policy	doesn’t	have	to	be	restated	over	and	over
again.	In	fact,	formally	developing	policies	saves	time	and	provides	structure:
Instead	of	using	valuable	time	trying	to	figure	out	what	to	do,	employees	will
know	exactly	what	to	do.
Incorporating	Standards
A	
standard
	deals	with	specific	issues	or	aspects	of	a	business.	Standards	are

derived	from	policies.	A	standard	should	provide	enough	detail	that	an	audit	can
be	performed	to	determine	whether	the	standard	is	being	met.	Standards,	like
policies,	have	certain	structural	aspects	in	common.
The	following	five	points	are	the	key	aspects	of	standards	documents:
Scope	and	Purpose
	The	
standards	document
	should	explain	or	describe	the
intention.	If	a	standard	is	developed	for	a	technical	implementation,	the	scope
might	include	software,	updates,	add-ins,	and	any	other	relevant	information	that
helps	the	implementer	carry	out	the	task.
Roles	and	Responsibilities
	This	section	of	the	standards	document	outlines	who
is	responsible	for	implementing,	monitoring,	and	maintaining	the	standard.	In	a
system	configuration,	this	section	would	outline	what	the	customer	is	supposed
to	accomplish	and	what	the	installer	is	supposed	to	accomplish.	This	doesn’t
mean	that	one	or	the	other	can’t	exceed	those	roles;	it	means	that,	in	the	event	of
confusion,	it’s	clear	who	is	responsible	for	accomplishing	which	tasks.
Reference	Documents
	This	section	of	the	standards	document	explains	how	the
standard	relates	to	the	organization’s	different	policies,	thereby	connecting	the
standard	to	the	underlying	policies	that	have	been	put	in	place.	In	the	event	of
confusion	or	uncertainty,	it	also	allows	people	to	go	back	to	the	source	and	figure
out	what	the	standard	means.	You’ll	encounter	many	situations	throughout	your
career	where	you’re	given	a	standard	that	doesn’t	make	sense.	Frequently,	by
referring	to	the	policies,	you	can	figure	out	why	the	standard	was	written	as	it
was.	Doing	so	may	help	you	carry	out	the	standard	or	inform	the	people
responsible	for	the	standard	of	a	change	or	problem.
Performance	Criteria
	This	part	of	the	standards	document	outlines	how	to
accomplish	the	task.	It	should	include	relevant	baseline	and	technology
standards.	Baselines	provide	a	minimum	or	starting	point	for	the	standard.
Technology	standards	provide	information	about	the	platforms	and	technologies.
Baseline	standards	spell	out	high-level	requirements	for	the	standard	or
technology.
 An	important	aspect	of	performance	criteria	is	benchmarking.	You
need	to	define	what	will	be	measured	and	the	metrics	that	will	be	used	to	do
so.

If	you’re	responsible	for	installing	a	server	in	a	remote	location,	for	example,	the
standards	spell	out	what	type	of	computer	will	be	used,	what	operating	system
will	be	installed,	and	any	other	relevant	specifications.
Maintenance	and	Administrative	Requirements
	These	standards	outline	what
is	required	to	manage	and	administer	the	systems	or	networks.	For	instance,	in
the	case	of	a	physical	security	requirement,	the	frequency	with	which	locks	or
combinations	are	changed	would	be	addressed.
As	you	can	see,	the	standards	documents	provide	a	mechanism	for	both	new	and
existing	standards	to	be	evaluated	for	compliance.	The	process	of	evaluation	is
called	an	
audit
.	Increasingly,	organizations	are	being	required	to	conduct	regular
audits	of	their	standards	and	policies.
Following	Guidelines
Guidelines	are	slightly	different	from	either	policies	or	standards.	
Guidelines
help	an	organization	implement	or	maintain	standards	by	providing	information
on	how	to	accomplish	the	policies	and	maintain	the	standards.
Guidelines	can	be	less	formal	than	policies	or	standards	because	their	nature	is	to
help	users	comply	with	policies	and	standards.	An	example	might	be	an
explanation	of	how	to	install	a	service	pack	and	what	steps	should	be	taken
before	doing	so.
Guidelines	aren’t	hard-and-fast	rules.	They	may,	however,	provide	a	step-by-step
process	to	accomplish	a	task.	Guidelines,	like	standards	and	policies,	should
contain	background	information	to	help	a	user	perform	the	task.
The	following	four	items	represent	the	minimum	contents	of	a	good	guidelines
document:
Scope	and	Purpose
	The	
scope	and	purpose
	section	provides	an	overview	and
statement	of	the	guideline’s	intent.	It	is	not	uncommon	to	see	the	heading
“Purpose	and	Scope”	or	“Scope	and	Purpose”	at	the	beginning	of	a	document
followed	by	verbiage	to	the	effect:	“This	document	contains	the	guidelines	and
procedures	for	the	assignment	and	use	of	
xyz
	and	establishes	the	minimum
requirements	for	governing	the	acceptable	use	of…”
Where	scope	and	purpose	are	two	separate	headings,	the	information	beneath	the
“Purpose”	section	states	why	it	exists	(for	example,	“This	policy	establishes
guidelines	and	minimum	requirements	governing…”),	and	the	“Scope”	section
tells	to	whom	it	applies	(for	instance,	“This	policy	applies	to	any	employee

who…”).
Roles	and	Responsibilities
	This	section	of	the	guidelines	identifies	which
individuals	or	departments	are	responsible	for	accomplishing	specific	tasks.	This
may	include	implementation,	support,	and	administration	of	a	system	or	service.
In	a	large	organization,	it’s	likely	that	the	individuals	involved	in	the	process	will
have	different	levels	of	training	and	expertise.	From	a	security	perspective,	it
could	be	disastrous	if	an	unqualified	technician	installed	a	system	without
guidelines.
Guideline	Statements
	The	
guideline	statements
	provide	the	step-by-step
instructions	or	procedures	on	how	to	accomplish	a	task	in	a	specific	manner.
Again,	these	are	guidelines	or	recommendations—they	may	not	be	hard-and-fast
rules	and	can	even	include	shortcuts	and	suggestions.
Operational	Considerations
	A	procedure’s	
operational	considerations
	specify
and	identify	what	duties	are	required	and	at	what	intervals.	This	list	might
include	daily,	weekly,	and	monthly	tasks.	Guidelines	for	systems	backup,	for
example,	might	provide	specific	guidance	as	to	which	files	and	directories	must
be	backed	up	and	how	frequently.
Guidelines	help	an	organization	in	three	ways:
If	a	process	or	set	of	steps	isn’t	performed	routinely,	experienced	support
and	security	staff	will	forget	how	to	do	them;	guidelines	will	help	refresh
their	memory.
When	you’re	trying	to	train	someone	to	do	something	new,	written
guidelines	can	reduce	the	new	person’s	learning	curve.
When	a	crisis	or	high-stress	situation	occurs,	guidelines	can	keep	you	from
coming	unglued.
Business	Policies	to	Implement
Business	policies	also	affect	the	security	of	an	organization.	They	address
organizational	and	departmental	business	issues	as	opposed	to	corporate-wide
personnel	issues.	When	developing	your	business	policy,	you	must	consider
these	primary	areas	of	concern.	Policies	can	be	divided	into	two	general
categories:	those	for	vendors	and	those	for	personnel.
Implementing	Policies	for	Vendors
The	overriding	policy	for	operations	is	the	
standard	operating	procedure	(SOP)
.

This	serves	as	the	baseline	for	business	and,	if	properly	written,	covers	what	is
expected	on	a	regular	basis.	More	importantly,	from	a	crisis	management
standpoint,	it	outlines	what	to	do	when	things	aren’t	running	as	well	as	they
should,	such	as	which	vendor	to	call	when	the	communications	server	crashes,
who	to	notify	when	their	keypads	won’t	allow	access	to	the	server	room,	and	so
on.
Service-level	agreements	(SLAs)
	were	discussed	previously,	and	equally
important	are	
business	partner	agreements	(BPAs)
.	These	outline	responsibilities
and	obligations	(as	well	as	the	sharing	of	profits	and	losses)	between	business
partners.	These	documents	can	be	important	when	you	need	authorization	before
or	after	a	disaster	to	get	the	help	and	equipment	needed	to	have	everything
functioning	as	it	should	be.
For	the	most	part	synonymous,	
memorandum	of	understanding	(MOU)
	and
memorandum	of	agreement	(MOA)
	define	the	terms	and	conditions	for	securely
sharing	data	and	information	resources.	It	is	important	that	it	identify	the
purpose	for	the	interconnection’s	existence.	It	should	also	identify	who	the
relevant	authorities	are	within	each	organization	and	define	their	responsibilities.
Since	nothing	lasts	forever,	conditions	of	terminating	the	agreement	should	be
included	in	it	as	well	as	expected	cost	apportionment.
An	
interconnection	security	agreement	(ISA)
	documents	the	technical	and
security	requirements	for	establishing,	operating,	and	maintaining	the
interconnection.	It	works	in	conjunction	with	the	MOU/A	between	organizations
by	spelling	out	the	requirements	for	connecting	the	IT	systems	and	describing
the	security	controls	to	be	used	to	protect	the	systems	and	data,	and	it	includes
any	necessary	topological	drawings	of	the	interconnection.
 Although	the	two	can	overlap,	the	general	guideline	is	that	the
ISA	specifies	the	technical	and	security	requirements	of	the	interconnection,
whereas	the	MOU/A	defines	the	responsibilities	of	each	organization.	As
such,	the	MOU/A	should	not	have	technical	details,	such	as	how	the
interconnection	is	going	to	be	established	or	maintained	within	it.	Those
details	are	contained	within	the	ISA.

 Given	the	sensitive	nature	of	the	information	contained	within	the
ISA	and	MOU/A,	it	is	imperative	that	their	physical	copies	be	stored	in	a
safe	and	secure	location	to	keep	them	from	prying	eyes.	It	is	also	important
that	electronic	copies	be	protected	from	those	same	prying	eyes.
Implementing	Policies	for	Personnel
For	exam	purposes,	there	are	more	policies	related	to	personnel—employees	and
contractors—with	which	you	should	be	familiar	than	for	vendors.	The	following
sections	look	at	them	and	guidelines	associated	with	them.
Mandatory	Vacations
	A	
mandatory	vacation	policy
	requires	employees	to	take
time	away	from	work	to	refresh,	and	it	is	primarily	used	in	jobs	related	to	the
financial	sector.	As	contradictory	as	it	may	seem,	an	employee	who	doesn’t	take
their	vacation	time	can	be	detrimental	to	their	own	health	as	well	as	the
organization’s	health.	If	the	company	becomes	too	dependent	on	one	person,
they	can	end	up	in	a	real	bind	if	something	should	happen	to	that	person.	Not
only	does	mandatory	vacation	give	the	employee	a	chance	to	refresh,	but	it	also
gives	the	company	a	chance	to	make	sure	that	others	can	fill	in	any	gaps	in
skills,	and	it	satisfies	the	need	to	have	replication	or	duplication	at	all	levels.
Mandatory	vacations	also	provide	an	opportunity	to	discover	fraud.
Job	Rotation
	A	
job	rotation	policy
	defines	intervals	at	which	employees	must
rotate	through	positions.	Similar	in	purpose	to	mandatory	vacations,	it	helps	to
ensure	that	the	company	does	not	become	too	dependent	on	one	person	(who
then	has	the	ability	to	do	enormous	harm).	Rotate	jobs	on	a	frequent	enough
basis	so	that	you	are	not	putting	yourself—and	your	data—at	the	mercy	of	any
one	administrator.	Just	as	you	want	redundancy	in	hardware,	you	want
redundancy	in	abilities.
When	one	person	fills	in	for	another,	such	as	for	mandatory	vacations,	it
provides	an	opportunity	to	see	what	the	person	is	doing	and	potentially	uncover
any	fraud.
Separation	of	Duties	Policies
	
Separation	of	duties	policies
	are	designed	to
reduce	the	risk	of	fraud	and	to	prevent	other	losses	in	an	organization.	A	good
policy	will	require	more	than	one	person	to	accomplish	key	processes.	This	may
mean	that	the	person	who	processes	an	order	from	a	customer	isn’t	the	same
person	who	generates	the	invoice	or	deals	with	the	billing.

Separation	of	duties	helps	prevent	various	problems,	such	as	an	individual
embezzling	money	from	a	company.	To	embezzle	funds	successfully,	an
individual	would	need	to	recruit	others	to	commit	an	act	of	
collusion
—that	is,	an
agreement	between	two	or	more	parties	established	for	the	purpose	of
committing	deception	or	fraud.	Collusion,	when	part	of	a	crime,	is	also	a
criminal	act	in	and	of	itself.
In	addition,	separation-of-duties	policies	can	help	prevent	accidents	from
occurring	in	an	organization.	Let’s	say	that	you’re	managing	a	software
development	project.	You	want	someone	to	perform	a	quality	assurance	test	on	a
new	piece	of	code	before	it’s	put	into	production.	Establishing	a	clear	separation
of	duties	prevents	development	code	from	entering	production	status	until
quality	testing	is	accomplished.
Many	banks	and	financial	institutions	require	multiple	steps	and	approvals	to
transfer	money.	This	helps	reduce	errors	and	minimizes	the	likelihood	of	fraud.
 Very	small	assaults	are	often	called	“salami	attacks.”	In	banking,
various	forms	of	salami	attacks	can	occur,	such	as	shaving	a	few	cents	from
many	accounts,	rounding	to	whole	numbers	and	compiling	the	remainder
into	one	account,	and	so	on.
Clean	Desk
	As	secure	as	data	within	a	computer	system	may	be,	equally
insecure	are	printed	copies	of	the	data	resting	in	a	pile	on	someone’s	desk.	A
clean	desk	policy	increases	the	physical	security	of	data	by	requiring	employees
to	limit	what	is	on	their	desk	to	what	they	are	working	on	at	the	present	time,
safely	securing	(locking	in	a	drawer,	for	example)	anything	not	presently	needed.
Background	Checks
	Given	the	need	to	protect	data,	one	of	the	best	ways	to	do
so	is	to	make	sure	those	who	are	given	access	to	it	can	be	trusted.	All	potential
employees	should	be	thoroughly	screened	with	an	extensive	background	check
before	being	hired	and	given	access	to	the	computer	systems.
Nondisclosure	Agreement
	A	nondisclosure	agreement	(NDA)	is	a	legal	contract
intended	to	cover	confidentiality.	An	NDA	can	be	crafted	and	accepted	to	cover
almost	any	scale.	It	can,	for	example,	be	limited	to	only	what	is	discussed	in	a
single	meeting	with	a	vendor	or	cover	everything	you	learned	during	the	course
of	your	employment.

Onboarding
	The	process	used	to	train	a	new	employee	and	bring	them	up	to
speed	with	the	organization,	its	clients,	its	products,	and	so	forth	is	known	as
onboarding.	From	the	organization’s	prospective,	this	process	can	represent	a
substantial	investment	in	the	new	employee	and	thus	the	organization	typically
wants	to	make	sure	they	made	a	smart	hiring	decision	and	are	going	to	keep	the
employee	for	a	while.	From	the	new	employee’s	standpoint,	they	are	usually
much	more	valuable	after	the	onboarding	has	concluded.
Continuing	Education
	Lifelong	learning	is	a	necessity	in	the	workplace	of
today.	Not	only	does	additional	learning	add	to	the	skills	an	employee	has	and
make	them	more	valuable	to	the	employer,	but	often	it	is	required	to	maintain
certifications.	Most	CompTIA	certifications	today	(including	Security+),	for
example,	require	a	minimum	number	of	continuing	education	units	(CEUs)	in
order	for	the	certified	administrator	to	keep	that	certification	over	time.
Exit	Interviews
	One	of	the	best	ways	to	find	problems	is	to	listen—not	talk—to
those	with	whom	you	work.	The	last	real	opportunity	for	that	communication
occurs	when	an	individual	leaves	the	organization	and	they	are	given	an	exit
interview.	Never	bypass	this	learning	opportunity,	and	be	sure	to	listen	carefully
to	what	is	being	said	and	ask	questions	that	can	help	you	determine	if	any
changes	should	be	made.
Role-Based	Awareness	Training
	Not	all	employees	are	equal,	and	that	is
especially	truly	when	it	comes	to	data	access.	Depending	on	your	organization,
you	may	use	groups	with	lots	of	different	names	and	assign	users	to	those
groups.	You	should,	however,	at	a	minimum	have	the	following:	Data	Owner,
System	Administrator,	System	Owner,	User,	Privileged	User,	and	Executive
User.
When	deciding	what	group	each	user	should	be	a	member	of,	the	
least	privilege
policy
	should	be	used,	particularly	when	assigning	permissions.	Give	users	only
the	permissions	that	they	need	to	do	their	work	and	no	more.	For	example,	a
temporary	employee	should	never	have	the	right	to	install	software,	a
receptionist	does	not	need	the	right	to	make	backups,	and	so	on.	Every	operating
system	includes	the	ability	to	limit	users	based	on	groups	and	individual
permissions,	and	your	company	should	adhere	to	the	policy	of	always	applying
only	those	permissions	users	need	and	blocking	those	that	they	do	not.
 Any	time	you	see	the	phrase	“least	privilege,”	always	equate	it	with

giving	only	the	minimum	permissions	needed	to	do	the	work	that	must	be
done.
Acceptable	Use	Policies
	
Acceptable	use	policies	(AUPs)
	describe	how	the
employees	in	an	organization	can	use	company	systems	and	resources,	both
software	and	hardware.	This	policy	should	also	outline	the	consequences	for
misuse.	In	addition,	the	policy	(also	known	as	a	
use	policy
)	should	address	the
installation	of	personal	software	on	company	computers	and	the	use	of	personal
hardware	such	as	USB	devices.	When	portable	devices	are	plugged	directly	into
a	machine,	they	bypass	the	network	security	measures	(such	as	firewalls)	and
allow	data	to	be	copied	in	what	is	known	as	
pod	slurping
.	This	can	also	be	done
if	employees	start	using	free	cloud	drives	instead,	and	that	scenario	should	be
addressed	in	the	AUP.
 Even	secure	workstations	that	do	not	contain	traditional	media
devices	(CD,	DVD,	and	so	forth)	usually	contain	USB	ports.	Unless	those
ports	are	disabled,	a	user	can	easily	connect	a	flash	drive	and	copy	files	to
and	from	it.	Not	only	should	you	make	every	effort	to	limit	USB	ports,	but
you	should	also	have	the	use	of	such	devices	spelled	out	in	the	acceptable
use	policy	to	circumvent	the	“I	didn’t	know”	defense.
 The	Trouble	with	Not	Having	a	Policy
A	few	years	ago,	an	employee	in	a	large	company	was	using	corporate
computer	systems	to	run	a	small	accounting	firm	that	he	had	started.	He	was
using	the	computers	on	his	own	time.	When	this	situation	was	discovered,	he
was	immediately	fired	for	the	misuse	of	corporate	resources.	He	sued	the
company	for	wrongful	discharge	and	won	the	case.	The	company	was	forced
to	hire	him	back	and	pay	his	back	wages,	and	he	was	even	awarded
damages.	The	primary	reason	the	company	lost	the	case	was	that	its
acceptable	use	policy	didn’t	state	that	he	couldn’t	use	company	computers
for	personal	work—only	that	he	couldn’t	use	them	for	personal	work	during

work	hours.	The	company	was	unable	to	prove	that	he	did	the	personal	work
during	work	hours.
Every	acceptable	use	policy	today	should	include	a	section	on	smartphone	usage
(and	even	presence)	within	the	workplace.	Although	a	smartphone	is	a
convenience	for	employees	(they	can	now	more	easily	receive	and	make
personal	calls	at	work),	it	can	be	a	headache	for	the	security	administrator.	Most
smartphones	can	store	files	in	the	same	way	as	any	USB	device,	and	they	can	be
used	to	copy	files	to	and	from	a	workstation.	Additionally,	the	camera	feature	on
most	phones	makes	it	possible	for	a	user	to	take	pictures	of	things	such	as
company	documents,	servers,	and	physical	security	implementation,	among
many	other	things	that	the	company	may	not	want	to	share.	For	this	reason,	most
secure	facilities	have	stringent	restrictions	on	the	presence	of	smartphones	within
the	facility.
 Make	sure	your	acceptable	use	policies	provide	your	company	with
adequate	coverage	regarding	all	acceptable	uses	of	corporate	resources.
Adverse	Actions
	It	is	a	sad	but	true	condition	in	the	workplace	that
administrative	(usually	adverse)	actions	must	be	taken	against	employees.	This
could	be	due	to	an	employee	being	forced	to	take	an	administrative	leave,	being
terminated,	or	any	number	of	other	situations.	An	adverse	action	policy	should
be	in	place	detailing	exactly	what	must	be	done—suspending	the	user’s	account,
revoking	privileges,	and	so	forth.
The	more	detailed	the	policy,	the	less	opportunity	there	is	for	something
important	to	fall	through	the	cracks	and	put	all	of	your	valuable	data	at	risk.	You
may	truly	work	with	the	best	co-workers	on	the	planet,	but	it	is	surprising	how
vindictive	they	can	become	if	they	feel	they’ve	been	wronged.	You	will	be	much
happier	if	you	can	stick	to	preventive	measures	and	head	off	problems	before
they	ever	have	the	opportunity	to	manifest	themselves.
General	Security	Policies
	
Security	policies
	define	what	controls	are	required	to
implement	and	maintain	the	security	of	systems,	users,	and	networks.	This
policy	should	be	used	as	a	guide	in	system	implementations	and	evaluations,
addressing	what	one	might	consider	common	sense.
Issues	that	should	be	defined	in	these	policies	include	the	difference	between

company	and	personal	email	and	how	to	deal	appropriately	with	social	media—
reminding	users	that	they	are	seen	as	an	extension	of	the	company	and	that	they
must	always	put	the	interests	of	the	company	first.	Both	social	media	and
personal	use	of	email	are	items	that	can	cause	companies	to	lose	big	in	the
marketplace	and	the	courtroom.	Users	need	to	understand	that	with	a	company
email	account	and/or	use	of	company	resources,	they	are	serving	as
representatives	of	the	company	and	any	offensive	comments	they	make	could
reflect	poorly	on	the	company.
Network/Application	Policies
As	you	just	learned,	anything	owned	by	the	company	is	thought	to	represent	the
company	in	both	the	marketplace	and	the	courtroom.	This	is	true	of	employees
using	company	email	accounts	for	personal	email,	the	use	of	company
computers	for	social	media,	and	for	all	other	applications	and	networks	that	the
employees	access	while	at	work	or	in	the	line	of	work.
Understanding	Control	Types	and	False
Positives/Negatives
Risk	assessment	and	analysis	involves	calculating	potential	risks	and	making
decisions	based	on	the	variables	associated	with	those	risks	(likelihood,	ALE,
impact,	and	so	forth).	Once	you’ve	identified	risks	that	you	want	to	address	with
actions	other	than	avoidance,	you	put	controls	in	place	to	address	those	risks.
Control	Types
The	National	Institute	of	Standards	and	Technology	places	controls	into
various	types.	The	control	types	fall	into	three	categories:	Management,
Operational,	and	Technical,	as	defined	in	Special	Publication	800-12.	
Table
1.3

Another	series	of	security	controls	worth	examining	is	NIST	800-53,	used	by
government	and	industry	and	viewed	as	more	of	a	global	standard.	As	of	this
writing,	the	current	publication	is	revision	4.
 Although	we	discussed	risk	assessment	in	this	chapter,	we
address	most	of	the	other	controls	in	subsequent	chapters.
After	you	have	implemented	security	controls	based	on	risk,	you	must	perform
routine	audits.	These	audits	should	include	reviews	of	user	rights	and
permissions	as	well	as	specific	events.	Pay	particular	attention	to	false	positives
and	negatives.
False	positives
	are	events	that	aren’t	really	incidents.	Event	flagging	is	often
based	on	established	rules	of	acceptance	(deviations	from	which	are	known	as
anomalies
)	and	things	such	as	attack	signatures.	If	the	rules	aren’t	set	up
properly,	normal	traffic	may	set	off	an	analyzer	and	generate	an	event.	You	don’t

want	to	declare	an	emergency	unless	you’re	sure	that	you	have	one.	The	opposite
of	a	false	positive	is	a	
false	negative
.	With	a	false	negative,	you	are	not	alerted	to
a	situation	when	you	should	be	alerted.	In	this	case,	you	miss	something	crucial
and	it	slips	right	by.
Error	Types
A	number	of	error	types	exist	beyond	what	you	need	to	know	for	the	exam.
Type	I	errors	are	those	with	false	positives—that	is,	you	think	that	evil	is
present	when	it	is	not.	You	have	to	be	careful	with	them	because	if	you
erroneously	raise	a	red	flag	and	it	turns	out	nothing	is	wrong,	it	becomes
more	difficult	to	get	anyone	to	listen	to	you	the	next	time	you	think	you’ve
uncovered	something	wrong	because	you’ve	lost	credibility.
Type	II	errors	are	those	with	false	negatives,	where	you	fail	to	notice	a
problem	even	though	it	is	there—that	is,	you	were	looking	directly	at	the	evil
and	didn’t	recognize	it.	These	errors	are	generally	considered	less	harmful
than	Type	I	errors,	though	they	allow	the	wrongdoer	to	get	away	with	the	act
and	maybe	even	keep	doing	it.
Type	III	errors	are	those	in	which	you	come	to	the	right	conclusion	for	all	of
the	wrong	reasons.	You	may	conclude	that	someone	broke	into	your	systems
because	users	are	having	trouble	logging	in.	Someone	did	indeed	break	into
the	system,	but	you	should	have	noticed	it	because	all	of	the	valuable	data	is
gone.
Risk	Management	Best	Practices
One	of	the	leading	ways	to	address	
business	continuity
	is	to	do	a	BIA	and
implement	
best	practices
.	Best	practices	are	based	on	what	is	known	in	the
industry	and	those	methods	that	have	consistently	shown	superior	results	over
those	achieved	by	other	means.
 You	need	only	a	passing	knowledge	of	business	continuity	issues
for	the	Security+	exam.	If	you	plan	on	taking	the	Project+	exam,	also	from

CompTIA,	you	will	need	a	more	thorough	knowledge	of	these	topics.
Undertaking	Business	Impact	Analysis
Business	impact	analysis	(BIA)
	is	the	process	of	evaluating	all	of	the	critical
systems	(important	to	core	business	functions)	in	an	organization	to	define
impact	and	recovery	plans.	BIA	isn’t	concerned	with	external	threats	or
vulnerabilities;	the	analysis	focuses	on	the	impact	a	loss	would	have	on	the
organization.
Here	are	the	key	components	of	a	BIA:
Identifying	Critical	Functions
	To	identify	critical	functions,	a	company	must
ask	itself,	“What	functions	are	necessary	to	continue	operations	until	full	service
can	be	restored?”	This	identification	process	will	help	you	establish	which
systems	must	be	returned	to	operation	in	order	for	the	business	to	continue.	In
performing	this	identification,	you	may	find	that	a	small	or	overlooked
application	in	a	department	may	be	critical	for	operations.	Many	organizations
have	overlooked	seemingly	insignificant	process	steps	or	systems	that	have
prevented	business	continuity	planning	(BCP)	from	being	effective.	Every
department	should	be	evaluated	to	ensure	that	no	critical	processes	are
overlooked.
Prioritizing	Critical	Business	Functions
	When	business	is	continued	after	an
event,	operations	must	be	prioritized	as	
mission-essential
	or	nonessential
functions.	If	the	organization	makes	resources	available	to	the	recovery	process,
these	resources	may	be	limited.	Furthermore,	in	a	widespread	outage,	full
operation	may	not	be	possible	for	some	time.	What	would	happen,	for	example,
if	your	data	communications	services	went	down?	You	can	usually	establish
temporary	services,	but	you	probably	won’t	be	able	to	restore	full	network
capability.	There	should	be	no	internal	disagreement	about	the	
identification	of
critical	systems
,	and	you	should	be	clear	about	which	applications	or	systems
have	priority	based	on	the	resources	available.	For	example,	your	company	may
find	itself	choosing	to	restore	email	before	it	restores	its	website.
Calculating	a	Timeframe	for	Critical	Systems	Loss
	How	long	can	the
organization	survive	without	a	critical	function?	Some	functions	in	an
organization	don’t	require	immediate	action	whereas	others	do.	Which	functions
must	be	reestablished	and	in	what	timeframe?	If	your	business	is	entirely
dependent	on	its	web	presence	and	is	e-commerce	oriented,	how	long	can	the
website	stay	inoperable?	Your	organization	may	need	to	evaluate	and	attempt	to

identify	the	maximum	time	that	a	particular	function	can	be	unavailable.	When
you	look	at	the	
impact
,	be	sure	to	factor	in	the	following	variables:
Life
	Is	anyone	in	immediate	jeopardy	because	of	the	failure?
Property
	Will	anything	be	lost	as	a	result	of	the	malfunction?
Safety
	Is	anyone	in	harm’s	way	due	to	the	crash?
Finance
	How	much	will	be	lost	due	to	the	stoppage?
Reputation
	How	harmful	is	the	breakdown	to	the	trust	of	the	organization?
This	component	dictates	the	contingencies	that	must	be	established	to	minimize
losses	due	to	exceeding	the	allowable	period.
Estimating	the	Tangible	and	Intangible	Impact	on	the	Organization
	Your
organization	will	suffer	losses	in	an	outage.	These	losses	will	be	tangible	in
nature,	such	as	lost	production	and	lost	sales.	Intangible	losses	will	also	be	a
factor.	For	example,	will	customers	lose	faith	in	your	service?	Knowing	the	true
cost	of	these	impacts	in	advance	will	greatly	increase	the	organization’s
effectiveness	in	responding	to	such	outages.
A	thorough	BIA	will	accomplish	several	organizational	goals:
The	true	impact	and	damage	that	an	outage	can	cause	will	be	visible.
Understanding	the	true	loss	potential	may	help	you	in	your	fight	for	a
budget.
Most	important,	perhaps,	the	process	will	document	which	business
processes	are	being	used,	the	impact	they	have	on	the	organization,	and
how	to	restore	them	quickly.
The	BIA	will	gain	power	in	the	organization	as	the	true	costs	of	an	outage
become	known.	People	buy	insurance	not	because	they	intend	to	have	an
accident	but	just	in	case	they	have	one.	A	BIA	can	help	identify	what	insurance
is	needed	for	the	organization	to	feel	safe.
Identifying	Critical	Systems	and	Components
Sometimes	your	systems	are	dependent	on	things	that	you	would	not	normally
consider.	Basic	utilities	such	as	electricity,	water,	and	natural	gas	are	key	aspects
of	business	continuity.	In	the	vast	majority	of	cases,	electricity	and	water	are
restored—at	least	on	an	emergency	basis—fairly	rapidly.	The	damage	created	by
blizzards,	tornadoes,	and	other	natural	disasters	is	managed	and	repaired	by

utility	companies	and	government	agencies.	Other	disasters,	such	as	a	major
earthquake	or	hurricane,	can	overwhelm	these	agencies,	and	services	may	be
interrupted	for	quite	a	while.	When	these	types	of	events	occur,	critical
infrastructure	may	be	unavailable	for	days,	weeks,	or	even	months.
 The	Importance	of	Utilities
When	the	earthquake	of	1989	occurred	in	San	Francisco,	California,	portions
of	the	city	were	without	electricity,	natural	gas,	and	water	for	several
months.	Entire	buildings	were	left	unoccupied	because	the	infrastructure	was
badly	damaged.	This	damage	prevented	many	businesses	whose	information
systems	departments	were	located	in	those	buildings	from	returning	to
operation	for	several	weeks.	Most	of	the	larger	organizations	were	able	to
shift	the	processing	loads	to	other	companies	or	divisions.
When	you	evaluate	your	business’s	sustainability,	realize	that	disasters	do	indeed
happen.	If	possible,	build	infrastructure	that	doesn’t	have	a	
single	point	of	failure
(SPOF)
	or	connection.	After	the	September	11,	2001,	terrorist	attack	on	the
World	Trade	Center	(WTC),	several	ISPs	and	other	companies	became
nonfunctional	because	the	WTC	housed	centralized	communications	systems
and	computer	departments.	If	you’re	the	administrator	for	a	small	company,	it	is
not	uncommon	for	the	SPOF	to	be	a	router/gateway.	The	best	way	to	remove	an
SPOF	from	your	environment	is	to	add	redundancy.
Consider	the	impact	of	weather	on	your	
contingency	plans
.	What	if	you	needed
to	relocate	your	facility	to	another	region	of	the	country	due	to	a	tornado	hitting
your	server	room?	How	would	you	get	personnel	there?	What	personnel	would
be	relocated?	How	would	they	be	housed	and	fed	during	the	time	of	the	crisis?
You	should	consider	these	possibilities	in	advance.	Although	the	possibility	of	a
crippling	disaster	is	relatively	small,	you	still	need	to	evaluate	the	risk.
 Formulating	Business	Continuity	Plans

As	a	security	administrator,	you	need	to	think	through	a	way	to	maintain
business	continuity	should	a	crisis	occur.	Imagine	that	your	company	is
involved	in	each	of	the	following	three	scenarios:
Scenario	1
Your	company	is	in	the	business	of	monitoring	criminal	offenders	who	are
under	electronic	house	arrest	nationwide.	Every	offender	wears	an	ankle
bracelet	that	wirelessly	communicates	with	a	device	in	his	or	her	home.	The
home	device	communicates	to	your	site	in	real	time	over	phone	lines	by
calling	a	toll-free	number	to	report	if	the	offender	is	in	or	out	of	the	home,
and	you	alert	local	authorities	immediately	if	someone	isn’t	in	compliance.
The	number	of	offenders,	and	the	number	of	home	devices	that	call	your
center,	is	in	the	tens	of	thousands.	How	could	business	be	maintained	if	the
trunk	line	for	the	toll-free	phone	carrier	were	disrupted	in	the	middle	of	the
night?	How	could	you	verify	offender	compliance	if	the	problem	took	hours
to	correct?
Scenario	2
You’re	the	administrator	for	a	small	educational	company	that	delivers
certification	exams	locally.	The	exams	are	downloaded	the	night	before	and
delivered	throughout	the	day	as	students—who	have	registered	over	the
Internet—arrive.	You	show	up	at	8	a.m.	on	Friday,	knowing	that	there	are
more	than	20	exams	to	be	administered	that	were	downloaded	Thursday
night.	What	you	find,	however,	is	that	someone	has	broken	into	the	testing
room	and	trashed	all	of	the	workstations	and	monitors.	Some	of	those
coming	to	take	the	exams	are	driving	from	far	away.	How	will	you	approach
the	situation?
Scenario	3
You’re	the	database	administrator	for	a	large	grocery	chain.	When	you	leave
on	Wednesday,	there	are	no	problems.	When	you	arrive	on	Thursday—the
day	a	new	sale	starts—you	learn	that	the	DSL	lines	are	down.	They	went
down	before	the	local	stores	could	download	the	new	sale	prices.	All
scanned	goods	will	ring	up	at	the	price	they	were	last	week	(either	sale	or
regular)	and	not	at	current	prices.	The	provider	says	it’s	working	on	the	DSL
problem	but	can’t	estimate	how	long	the	repairs	will	take.	How	do	you
approach	the	problem?

Just	like	in	the	real	world,	there	are	no	right	or	wrong	answers	for	these
scenarios.	However,	they	all	represent	situations	that	have	happened	and	for
which	administrators	planned	ahead	of	time.
There	are	several	ways	to	plan	for	such	scenarios,	including	implementing
redundant	technology,	fault-tolerant	systems,	and	RAID.	A	truly	redundant
system	won’t	use	just	one	of	these	methods,	but	rather	it	will	support	some
aspect	of	all	of	them.	The	following	sections	address	these	topics	in	more
detail.
As	an	administrator,	you	should	always	be	aware	of	problems	that	can	occur	and
have	an	idea	of	how	you’ll	approach	them.	It’s	impossible	to	prepare	for	every
emergency,	but	you	can	plan	for	those	that	could	conceivably	happen.
Automation/Scripting
The	days	of	relying	on	someone	in	the	server	room	to	see	a	problem	and	push	a
button	to	head	it	off	are	coming	to	a	close.	Thanks	to	sophisticated	monitors	and
sensors,	it	is	possible	to	use	
automation/scripting
	in	a	wide	variety	of	scenarios
to	preplan	
automated	courses	of	action
.	Scenarios	in	which	the	automated
courses	of	action	can	be	taken	range	from	
configuration	validation
	of	new
equipment	added	on	the	network	to	
continuous	monitoring
	of	server	operations.
Frameworks	and	Templates
Templates
	can	be	helpful	in	the	risk	assessment	process	by	providing	a	means	to
summarize	and	document	results	of	threat	source	identification,	characterization,
vulnerabilities,	and	impacts.	Typical	templates	include	scales	for	evaluating	the
threats	and	deciding	the	best	responses	to	them.
Master	Image
Most	newer	operating	systems	allow	you	to	create	a	model	user	system	as	a	disk
image	on	a	server;	the	disk	image	is	downloaded	and	installed	when	a	failure
occurs.	This	method	makes	it	easier	for	administrators	to	restore	a	system	than	it
would	be	to	do	it	manually.
Nonpersistence
Persistent	images	are	those	that	stay	the	same,	while	nonpersistent	are	those	that
are	temporary.	They	can	exist	only	in	RAM	or	be	changes	that	are	overwritten	on

a	reboot	by	a	persistent/frozen	image.
In	a	nutshell,	a	system	image	(referenced	earlier)	is	a	
snapshot
	of	what	exists.
Capturing	an	image	of	the	operating	system	in	its	exploited	state	can	be	helpful
in	revisiting	the	issue	after	the	fact	to	learn	more	about	it.	As	an	analogy,	think	of
germ	samples	that	are	stored	in	labs	after	major	outbreaks	so	that	scientists	can
revisit	them	later	and	study	them	further.
Most	newer	operating	systems	take	snapshots	of	the	configuration	at	various
times	and	these	can	be	manually	created	as	well	(which	is	highly	recommended
before	updates	or	major	system	changes).	When	something	goes	awry,	you	can
revert	to	known	state
—that	is,	go	back	to	the	configuration	as	it	was	before	the
last	major	change.	This	ability	to	
roll	back	to	a	known	configuration
	is	helpful
on	workstations	as	well	as	servers.
When	all	else	fails,	you	can	often	use	
live	boot	media
	to	boot	a	system	and	begin
troubleshooting	it.	You	can	usually	create	bootable	flash	drives	and/or	DVDs
based	on	the	operating	system	you	are	using	and	the	abilities	it	offers.	Bear	in
mind	that	for	the	live	boot	media	to	work,	the	system	on	which	you	are	working
must	be	configured	to	boot	from	that	media.
Elasticity
Elasticity
	is	a	major	feature	of	cloud	computing,	meaning	the	ability	to	scale	up
resources	as	needed.	A	number	of	other	benefits	go	along	with	it:	the	time	to
service	is	a	possibility,	as	is	the	mean	time	to	implement	being	quicker	inside
rather	than	outside	the	virtual	model,	or	resource	pooling.	Other	features	that
make	elasticity	so	valuable	include	using	multitenant	models,	and	the	fact	that	it
is	scalable	not	only	up	but	also	down,	and	applications	are	both	available	and
portable.
Scalability
Speaking	of	scaling	both	up	and	down,	
scalability
	is	always	a	desired	attribute	of
any	system.	A	virtual	datacenter,	for	example,	appears	the	same	as	a	physical
datacenter	from	an	administration	standpoint,	and	it	features	elasticity,
scalability,	and	so	forth.	A	big	benefit	of	the	virtual	center	is	that	it	can	employ	a
pay-as-you-go	model.
Distributive	Allocation
Commonly	known	as	load	balancing,	
distributive	allocation
	allows	for

distributing	the	load	(file	requests,	data	routing,	and	so	on)	so	that	no	device	is
overly	burdened.	This	can	help	with	redundancy,	availability,	and	fault	tolerance.
High	Availability
High	availability	(HA)
	refers	to	the	measures,	such	as	redundancy,	failover,	and
mirroring,	used	to	keep	services	and	systems	operational	during	an	outage.	In
short,	the	goal	is	to	provide	all	services	to	all	users,	where	they	need	them	and
when	they	need	them.	With	high	availability,	the	goal	is	to	have	key	services
available	99.999	percent	of	the	time	(also	known	as	
five	nines	availability)
.
Planning	for	Resiliency
Resiliency
	is	the	capacity	to	recover	quickly	from	difficulties.	Few	things	are	as
difficult	in	the	world	of	IT	as	a	crash	or	failure—be	it	at	the	server	level	or	the
server	room	level.	This	chapter	is	focused	on	how	to	compute	and	manage	risk
and	increase	your	resiliency	when	it	is	economically	feasible	to	do	so.	For	the
most	part,	risk	resilience	is	a	buzzword	that	can	be	equated	with	risk
management.
Redundancy
Redundancy
	refers	to	systems	that	either	are	duplicated	or	
fail	over
	to	other
systems	in	the	event	of	a	malfunction.	
Failover
	refers	to	the	process	of
reconstructing	a	system	or	switching	over	to	other	systems	when	a	failure	is
detected.	In	the	case	of	a	server,	the	server	switches	to	a	redundant	server	when	a
fault	is	detected.	This	strategy	allows	service	to	continue	uninterrupted	until	the
primary	server	can	be	restored.	In	the	case	of	a	network,	this	means	processing
switches	to	another	network	path	in	the	event	of	a	network	failure	in	the	primary
path.
 Failover	systems	can	be	expensive	to	implement.	In	a	large
corporate	network	or	e-commerce	environment,	a	failover	might	entail
switching	all	processing	to	a	remote	location	until	your	primary	facility	is
operational.	The	primary	site	and	the	remote	site	would	synchronize	data	to
ensure	that	information	is	as	up	to	date	as	possible.
Many	operating	systems,	such	as	Linux,	Windows	Server	2012,	and	Novell

Open	Enterprise	Server,	are	capable	of	
clustering
	to	provide	failover	capabilities.
Clustering
	involves	multiple	systems	connected	together	cooperatively	(which
provides	
load	balancing
)	and	networked	in	such	a	way	that	if	any	of	the	systems
fail,	the	other	systems	take	up	the	slack	and	continue	to	operate.	The	overall
capability	of	the	server	cluster	may	decrease,	but	the	network	or	service	will
remain	operational.
 To	appreciate	the	beauty	of	clustering,	contemplate	the	fact	that
this	is	the	technology	on	which	Google	is	built.	Not	only	does	clustering
allow	you	to	have	redundancy,	but	it	also	offers	you	the	ability	to	scale	as
demand	increases.
Most	ISPs	and	network	providers	have	extensive	internal	failover	capability	to
provide	high	availability	to	clients.	Business	clients	and	employees	who	are
unable	to	access	information	or	services	tend	to	lose	confidence.	The	trade-off
for	reliability	and	trustworthiness,	of	course,	is	cost:	failover	systems	can
become	prohibitively	expensive.	You’ll	need	to	study	your	needs	carefully	to
determine	whether	your	system	requires	this	capability.	For	example,	if	your
environment	requires	a	high	level	of	availability,	your	servers	should	be
clustered.	This	will	allow	the	other	servers	in	the	network	to	take	up	the	load	if
one	of	the	servers	in	the	cluster	fails.
Fault	Tolerance
Fault	tolerance
	is	the	ability	of	a	system	to	sustain	operations	in	the	event	of	a
component	failure.	Fault-tolerant	systems	can	continue	operation	even	though	a
critical	component,	such	as	a	disk	drive,	has	failed.	This	capability	involves
over-engineering	systems	by	adding	redundant	components	and	subsystems.
 Fault	tolerance	is	discussed	in	more	detail	in	Chapter	7,	“Data
and	Privacy	Security	Practices,”	but	it	appears	here	as	it	relates	to	risk.
Fault	tolerance	can	be	built	into	a	server	by	adding	a	second	power	supply,	a
second	CPU,	and	other	key	components.	Several	manufacturers	(such	as	HP,

Unisys,	and	IBM)	offer	fault-tolerant	servers.	These	servers	typically	have
multiple	processors	that	automatically	fail	over	if	a	malfunction	occurs.
 In	addition	to	fault-tolerant	servers,	you	can	have	fault-tolerant
implementations	such	as	Tandem,	Stratus,	and	HP.	In	these	settings,	multiple
computers	are	used	to	provide	100	percent	availability	of	a	single	server.
There	are	two	key	components	of	fault	tolerance	that	you	should	never	overlook:
spare	parts	and	electrical	power.	Spare	parts	should	always	be	readily	available
to	repair	any	system-critical	component	if	it	should	fail.	The	redundancy	strategy
“N+1”	means	that	you	have	the	number	of	components	you	need,	plus	one	to
plug	into	any	system	should	it	be	needed.	For	example,	a	small	company	with
five	stand-alone	servers	that	are	all	the	same	model	should	have	a	power	supply
in	a	box	nearby	to	install	in	any	one	of	the	servers	should	there	be	a	failure.	(The
redundancy	strategy	1+1	[or	2N]	has	one	spare	part	for	every	component	in	use.)
Since	computer	systems	cannot	operate	in	the	absence	of	electrical	power,	it	is
imperative	that	fault	tolerance	be	built	into	your	electrical	infrastructure	as	well.
At	a	bare	minimum,	an	
uninterruptible	power	supply	(UPS)
—with	surge
protection—should	accompany	every	server	and	workstation.	That	UPS	should
be	rated	for	the	load	it	is	expected	to	carry	in	the	event	of	a	power	failure
(factoring	in	the	computer,	monitor,	and	any	other	device	connected	to	it)	and	be
checked	periodically	as	part	of	your	preventive	maintenance	routine	to	make
sure	that	the	battery	is	operational.	You	will	need	to	replace	the	battery	every
few	years	to	keep	the	UPS	operational.
A	UPS	will	allow	you	to	continue	to	function	in	the	absence	of	power	for	only	a
short	duration.	For	fault	tolerance	in	situations	of	longer	duration,	you	will	need
a	
backup	generator
.	Backup	generators	run	off	of	gasoline,	propane,	natural	gas,
or	diesel	and	generate	the	electricity	needed	to	provide	steady	power.	Although
some	backup	generators	can	come	on	instantly	in	the	event	of	a	power	outage,
most	take	a	short	time	to	warm	up	before	they	can	provide	consistent	power.
Therefore,	you	will	find	that	you	still	need	to	implement	UPSs	within	your
organization.
Redundant	Array	of	Independent	Disks
Redundant	Array	of	Independent	Disks	(RAID)
	is	a	technology	that	uses	multiple

disks	to	provide	fault	tolerance.	There	are	several	designations	for	RAID	levels.
 RAID	stands	for	not	only	
Redundant	Array	of	Independent	Disks
but	also	
Redundant	Array	of	Inexpensive	Disks
.	Although	the	latter	term	has
lost	its	popularity,	you	might	still	encounter	it	in	some	books.
The	most	commonly	implemented	RAID	levels	are	as	follows:
RAID	Level	0
	RAID	0	is	
disk	striping
.	It	uses	multiple	drives	and	maps	them
together	as	a	single	physical	drive.	This	is	done	primarily	for	performance,	not
for	fault	tolerance.	If	any	drive	in	a	RAID	0	array	fails,	the	entire	logical	drive
becomes	unusable.
RAID	Level	1
	RAID	1	is	
disk	mirroring
.	Disk	mirroring	provides	100	percent
redundancy	because	everything	is	stored	on	two	disks.	If	one	disk	fails,	another
disk	continues	to	operate.	The	failed	disk	can	be	replaced,	and	the	RAID	1	array
can	be	regenerated.	This	system	offers	the	advantage	of	100	percent	data
redundancy	at	the	expense	of	doubling	the	storage	requirements.	Each	drive
keeps	an	exact	copy	of	all	information,	which	reduces	the	effective	storage
capability	to	50	percent	of	the	overall	rated	storage.	Some	implementations	of
disk	mirroring	are	called	
disk	duplexing
	(
duplexing
	is	a	less	commonly	used
term).	The	difference	between	mirroring	and	duplexing	is	one	more	controller
card.	With	mirroring,	one	controller	card	writes	sequentially	to	each	disk.	With
duplexing,	the	same	data	is	written	to	both	disks	simultaneously.	Disk	duplexing
has	much	faster	write	performance	than	disk	mirroring.	Many	hardware
implementations	of	RAID	1	are	actually	duplexing,	but	they	are	still	generally
referred	to	as	mirrors.
 The	data	is	intact	in	a	RAID	1	array	if	either	one	of	the	two	drives
fails.	After	the	failed	drive	is	replaced	with	a	new	drive,	you	remirror	the
data	from	the	good	drive	to	the	new	drive	to	re-create	the	array.
RAID	Level	3
	RAID	3	is	
disk	striping	with	a	parity	disk
.	RAID	3	arrays
implement	fault	tolerance	by	using	striping	(RAID	0)	in	conjunction	with	a
separate	disk	that	stores	parity	information.	
Parity	information
	is	a	value	based

on	the	value	of	the	data	stored	in	each	disk	location.	This	system	ensures	that	the
data	can	be	recovered	in	the	event	of	a	failure.	The	process	of	generating	parity
information	uses	the	arithmetic	value	of	the	data	binary.	This	process	allows	any
single	disk	in	the	array	to	fail	while	the	system	continues	to	operate.	The	failed
disk	is	removed,	a	new	disk	is	installed,	and	the	new	drive	is	then	regenerated
using	the	parity	information.	RAID	3	is	common	in	older	systems,	and	it’s
supported	by	most	Unix	systems.
RAID	Level	5
	RAID	5	is	
disk	striping	with	parity
,	and	it	is	one	of	the	most
common	forms	of	RAID	in	use	today.	It	operates	similarly	to	disk	striping,	as	in
RAID	0.	The	parity	information	is	spread	across	all	of	the	disks	in	the	array
instead	of	being	limited	to	a	single	disk,	as	in	RAID	3.	Most	implementations
require	a	minimum	of	three	disks	and	support	a	maximum	of	32.
These	four	types	of	RAID	drives,	or	arrays,	are	illustrated	in	
Figure	1.1
