Introduction
This	book	is	drawn	from	more	than	20	years	of	IT	experience.	I	have	taken	that	experience	and
translated	it	into	a	Windows	Server	2016	book	that	will	help	you	not	only	prepare	for	the
MCSA:	Windows	Server	2016	exams	but	also	develop	a	clear	understanding	of	how	to	install
and	configure	Windows	Server	2016	while	avoiding	all	of	the	possible	configuration	pitfalls.
Many	Microsoft	books	just	explain	the	Windows	operating	system,	but	with	
MCSA:	Windows
Server	2016	Complete	Study	Guide
,	I	go	a	step	further	by	providing	many	in-depth,	step-by-
step	procedures	to	support	my	explanations	of	how	the	operating	system	performs	at	its	best.
Microsoft	Windows	Server	2016	is	the	newest	version	of	Microsoft’s	server	operating	system
software.	Microsoft	has	taken	the	best	of	Windows	Server	2003,	Windows	Server	2008,	and
Windows	Server	2012	and	combined	them	into	the	latest	creation,	Windows	Server	2016.
Windows	Server	2016	eliminates	many	of	the	problems	that	plagued	the	previous	versions	of
Windows	Server,	and	it	includes	a	much	faster	boot	time	and	shutdown.	It	is	also	easier	to
install	and	configure,	and	it	barely	stops	to	ask	the	user	any	questions	during	installation.	In	this
book,	I	will	show	you	what	features	are	installed	during	the	automated	installation	and	where
you	can	make	changes	if	you	need	to	be	more	in	charge	of	your	operating	system	and	its
features.
This	book	takes	you	through	all	the	ins	and	outs	of	Windows	Server	2016,	including
installation,	configuration,	Group	Policy	Objects,	auditing,	backups,	and	so	much	more.
Windows	Server	2016	has	improved	on	Microsoft’s	desktop	environment,	made	networking
easier,	enhanced	searching	capability,	and	improved	performance—and	that’s	only	scratching
the	surface.
When	all	is	said	and	done,	this	is	a	technical	book	for	IT	professionals	who	want	to	take
Windows	Server	2016	to	the	next	step	and	get	certified.	With	this	book,	you	will	not	only	learn
Windows	Server	2016	and	ideally	pass	the	exams,	but	you	will	also	become	a	Windows
Server	2016	expert.
The	Microsoft	Certification	Program
Since	the	inception	of	its	certification	program,	Microsoft	has	certified	more	than	2	million
people.	As	the	computer	network	industry	continues	to	increase	in	both	size	and	complexity,
this	number	is	sure	to	grow—and	the	need	for	proven	ability	will	also	increase.	Certifications
can	help	companies	verify	the	skills	of	prospective	employees	and	contractors.
The	Microsoft	certification	tracks	for	Windows	Server	2016	include	the	following:
MCSA:	Windows	Server	2016
	The	MCSA	is	now	the	lowest-level	certification	you	can
achieve	with	Microsoft	in	relation	to	Windows	Server	2016.	It	requires	passing	three	exams:

70-740,	70-741,	and	70-742.
MCSE:	Cloud	Platform	and	Infrastructure
	The	MCSE	certifications,	in	relation	to	Windows
Server	2016,	require	that	you	become	an	MCSA	first	and	then	pass	two	additional	exams.	The
additional	exams	will	vary	depending	on	which	of	the	two	MCSE	tracks	you	choose.	For	more
information,	visit	Microsoft’s	website	at	
www.microsoft.com/learning
.
How	Do	You	Become	Certified	on	Windows	Server	2016?
Attaining	Microsoft	certification	has	always	been	a	challenge.	In	the	past,	students	have	been
able	to	acquire	detailed	exam	information—even	most	of	the	exam	questions—from	online
“brain	dumps”	and	third-party	“cram”	books	or	software	products.	For	the	new	generation	of
exams,	this	is	simply	not	the	case.
Microsoft	has	taken	strong	steps	to	protect	the	security	and	integrity	of	its	new	certification
tracks.	Now	prospective	candidates	must	complete	a	course	of	study	that	develops	detailed
knowledge	about	a	wide	range	of	topics.	It	supplies	them	with	the	true	skills	needed,	derived
from	working	with	the	technology	being	tested.
The	new	generations	of	Microsoft	certification	programs	are	heavily	weighted	toward	hands-
on	skills	and	experience.	It	is	recommended	that	candidates	have	troubleshooting	skills
acquired	through	hands-on	experience	and	working	knowledge.
Fortunately,	if	you	are	willing	to	dedicate	the	time	and	effort	to	learn	Windows	Server	2016,
you	can	prepare	yourself	well	for	the	exam	by	using	the	proper	tools.	By	working	through	this
book,	you	can	successfully	meet	the	requirements	to	pass	the	Windows	Server	2016	exams.
MCSA	Exam	Requirements
Candidates	for	MCSA	certification	on	Windows	Server	2016	must	pass	at	least	the	following
three	Windows	Server	2016	exams:
70-740:
	Installation,	Storage,	and	Compute	with	Windows	Server	2016
70-741:
	Networking	with	Windows	Server	2016
70-742:
	Identity	with	Windows	Server	2016
 For	those	who	have	a	qualifying	certification,	they	can	take	the	Upgrading
exam	“Upgrading	Your	Skills	to	MCSA:	Windows	Server	2016”	(Exam	70-743).	The
objectives	for	this	exam	span	the	three	individual	exams.	This	book	covers	all	of	the
objectives	for	the	Upgrading	exam.	For	details	about	the	exam,	visit	Microsoft’s	website
at	
www.microsoft.com/learning
.
Microsoft	provides	exam	objectives	to	give	you	a	general	overview	of	possible	areas	of
coverage	on	the	Microsoft	exams.	Keep	in	mind,	however,	that	exam	objectives	are	subject	to

change	at	any	time	without	prior	notice	and	at	Microsoft’s	sole	discretion.	Visit	the	Microsoft
Learning	website	(
www.microsoft.com/learning
)	for	the	most	current	listing	of	
exam
objectives.	The	published	objectives	and	how	they	map	to	this	book	are	listed	later	in	this
Introduction.

Tips	for	Taking	the	Windows	Server	2016	Exams
Here	are	some	general	tips	for	achieving	success	on	your	certification	exam:
Arrive	early	at	the	exam	center	so	that	you	can	relax	and	review	your	study	materials.
During	this	final	review,	you	can	look	over	tables	and	lists	of	exam-related	information.
Read	the	questions	carefully.	Do	not	be	tempted	to	jump	to	an	early	conclusion.	Make	sure
you	know	
exactly
	what	the	question	is	asking.
Answer	all	questions.	If	you	are	unsure	about	a	question,	mark	it	for	review	and	come	back
to	it	at	a	later	time.
On	simulations,	do	not	change	settings	that	are	not	directly	related	to	the	question.	Also,
assume	the	default	settings	if	the	question	does	not	specify	or	imply	which	settings	are
used.
For	questions	about	which	you’re	unsure,	use	a	process	of	elimination	to	get	rid	of	the
obviously	incorrect	answers	first.	This	improves	your	odds	of	selecting	the	correct	answer
when	you	need	to	make	an	educated	guess.
Exam	Registration
At	the	time	this	book	was	released,	Microsoft	exams	are	given	two	ways.	You	can	take	the
exam	live	online	or	through	the	more	than	1,000	Authorized	VUE	Testing	Centers	around	the
world.	For	the	location	of	a	testing	center	near	you,	go	to	VUE’s	website	at	
www.vue.com
.	If
you	are	outside	of	the	United	States	and	Canada,	contact	your	local	VUE	registration	center.
Find	out	the	number	of	the	exam	that	you	want	to	take	and	then	register	with	the	VUE
registration	center	nearest	to	you.	At	this	point,	you	will	be	asked	for	advance	payment	for	the
exam.	The	exams	are	$165	each,	and	you	must	take	them	within	one	year	of	payment.	You	can
schedule	exams	up	to	six	weeks	in	advance	or	as	late	as	one	working	day	prior	to	the	date	of
the	exam.	You	can	cancel	or	reschedule	your	exam	if	you	contact	the	center	at	least	two
working	days	prior	to	the	exam.	Same-day	registration	is	available	in	some	locations,	subject
to	space	availability.	Where	same-day	registration	is	available,	you	must	register	a	minimum
of	two	hours	before	test	time.

When	you	schedule	the	exam,	you	will	be	provided	with	instructions	regarding	appointment
and	cancellation	procedures,	ID	requirements,	and	information	about	the	testing	center
location.	In	addition,	you	will	receive	a	registration	and	payment	confirmation	letter	from
VUE.

What’s	Included	with	the	Book

This	book	includes	many	helpful	items	intended	to	prepare	you	for	the	MCSA:	Windows
Server	2016	certification.
Assessment	Test
	There	is	an	assessment	test	at	the	conclusion	of	the	Introduction	that	can	be
used	to	evaluate	quickly	where	you	are	with	Windows	Server	2016.	This	test	should	be	
taken
prior	to	beginning	your	work	in	this	book,	and	it	should	help	you	identify	areas	in	which	you
are	either	strong	or	weak.	Note	that	these	questions	are	purposely	more	simple	than	the	types	of
questions	you	may	see	on	the	exams.
Objective	Map	and	Opening	List	of	Objectives
	Later	in	this	Introduction,	I	include	a
detailed	exam	objective	map	showing	you	where	each	of	the	exam	objectives	are	covered.
Each	chapter	also	includes	a	list	of	the	exam	objectives	that	are	covered.
Helpful	Exercises
	Throughout	the	book,	I	have	included	step-by-step	exercises	of	some	of	the
more	important	tasks	that	you	should	be	able	to	perform.	Some	of	these	exercises	have
corresponding	videos	that	can	be	downloaded	from	the	book’s	website.	Also,	in	the	following
section	I	have	a	recommended	home	lab	setup	that	will	be	helpful	in	completing	these	tasks.
Exam	Essentials
	The	end	of	each	chapter	also	includes	a	listing	of	exam	essentials.	These	are
essentially	repeats	of	the	objectives,	but	remember	that	any	objective	on	the	exam	blueprint
could	show	up	on	the	exam.
Chapter	Review	Questions
	Each	chapter	includes	review	questions.	These	are	used	to	assess
your	understanding	of	the	chapter	and	are	taken	directly	from	the	chapter.	These	questions	are
based	on	the	exam	objectives,	and	they	are	similar	in	difficulty	to	items	you	might	actually
receive	on	the	MCSA:	Windows	Server	2016	exams.

followed	by	a	single	correct	answer).	You	can	use	the	flashcards	to	reinforce	your	learning	and
provide	last-minute	test	prep	before	the	exam.

Glossary
	
The	key	terms	from	this	book	and	their	definitions	are	available	as	a	fully	searchable
PDF.
Videos
	Some	of	the	exercises	include	corresponding	videos.	These	videos	show	you	how	the
author	does	the	exercises.	There	is	also	a	video	that	shows	you	how	to	set	up	virtualization	so
that	you	can	complete	the	exercises	within	a	virtualized	environment.	The	author	also	has
videos	to	help	you	on	the	Microsoft	exams	at	
www.youtube.com/c/williampanek
.
Recommended	Home	Lab	Setup
To	get	the	most	out	of	this	book,	you	will	want	to	make	sure	you	complete	the	exercises
throughout	the	chapters.	To	complete	the	exercises,	you	will	need	one	of	two	setups.	First,	you
can	set	up	a	machine	with	Windows	Server	2016	and	complete	the	labs	using	a	regular
Windows	Server	2016	machine.
The	second	way	to	set	up	Windows	Server	2016	(the	way	I	set	up	Server	2016)	is	by	using
virtualization.	I	set	up	Windows	Server	2016	as	a	virtual	hard	disk	(VHD),	and	I	did	all	the
labs	this	way.	The	advantages	of	using	virtualization	are	that	you	can	always	just	wipe	out	the
system	and	start	over	without	losing	a	real	server.	Plus,	you	can	set	up	multiple	virtual	servers
and	create	a	full	lab	environment	on	one	machine.
I	created	a	video	for	this	book	showing	you	how	to	set	up	a	virtual	machine	and	how	to	install
Windows	Server	2016	onto	that	virtual	machine.

This	objective	may	include	but	is	not	limited	to:	Determine	appropriate	usage
scenarios	and	requirements	for	Nano	Server;	install	Nano	Server;	implement	Roles
and	Features	on	Nano	Server.
 So,	you	have	decided	to	start	down	the	track	of	Windows	Server	2016.
The	first	question	you	must	ask	yourself	is	what’s	the	first	step?	Well,	the	first	step	is	to	learn
about	what	Windows	Server	2016	features	and	benefits	are	available	and	how	these	features
can	help	improve	your	organization’s	network.
So	that’s	where	I	am	going	to	start.	I	will	talk	about	the	different	Windows	Server	2016
versions	and	what	version	may	be	best	for	you.	After	I	show	you	some	of	the	new	and
improved	Windows	Server	2016	features,	I	will	then	show	you	how	to	install	these	different
versions	onto	your	network.
I	will	also	show	you	how	to	use	some	PowerShell	commands	in	the	Windows	Server	2016

installation.	Let’s	dive	right	into	the	server	by	talking	about	some	of	the	new	features	and
advantages	of	Windows	Server	2016.
 The	Windows	Server	2016	installations	will	all	be	done	on	a	virtual	server.
You	can	use	any	virtual	software	as	long	as	its	supports	Windows	Server	2016	and	64-bit
processors.
Features	and	Advantages	of	Windows	Server	2016
Before	I	show	how	to	install	and	configure	Windows	Server	2016,	let’s	take	a	look	at	some	of
the	new	features	and	the	advantages	it	offers.	Microsoft	has	stated	that	Windows	Server	2016
is	“the	cloud-ready	operating	system.”	This	means	that	many	of	the	features	of	Windows	Server
2016	are	built	and	evolve	around	cloud	based	software	and	networking.
 Since	many	of	you	will	be	upgrading	from	previous	versions	of	Windows
Server,	these	are	the	new	and/or	improved	features	introduced	by	Microsoft	since	then.	I
will	specifically	identify	any	new	features	or	advantages	that	are	new	to	Windows	Server
2016	only.
I	will	talk	about	all	of	these	features	in	greater	detail	throughout	this	book.	What	follows	are
merely	brief	descriptions.
Built-in	Security
	Microsoft	has	always	tried	to	make	sure	that	their	operating	systems	are	as
secure	as	possible,	but	with	Windows	Server	2016,	Microsoft	has	included	built-in	breach
resistance.	This	feature	helps	stop	attackers	on	your	system	and	allows	a	company	to	meet	any
compliance	requirements.
Active	Directory	Certificate	Services
	
Active	Directory	Certificate	Services	(AD	CS)
provides	a	customizable	set	of	services	that	allow	you	to	issue	and	manage	
public	key
infrastructure	(PKI)	certificates
.	These	certificates	can	be	used	in	software	security	systems
that	employ	public	key	technologies.
Active	Directory	Domain	Services
	
Active	Directory	Domain	Services	(AD	DS)
	includes	new
features	that	make	deploying	domain	controllers	simpler	and	that	let	you	implement	them	faster.
AD	DS	also	makes	the	domain	controllers	more	flexible,	both	to	audit	and	to	authorize	for
access	to	files.	Moreover,	AD	DS	has	been	designed	to	make	performing	administrative	tasks
easier	through	consistent	graphical	and	scripted	management	experiences.
Active	Directory	Rights	Management	Services
	
Active	Directory	Rights	Management

Services	(AD	RMS)
	provides	management	and	development	tools	that	let	you	work	with
industry	security	technologies,	including	encryption,	certificates,	and	authentication.	Using
these	technologies	allows	organizations	to	create	reliable	information	protection	solutions.
BitLocker
	
BitLocker
	is	a	tool	that	allows	you	to	encrypt	the	hard	drives	of	your	computer.	By
encrypting	the	hard	drives,	you	can	provide	enhanced	protection	against	data	theft	or
unauthorized	exposure	of	your	computers	or	removable	drives	that	are	lost	or	stolen.
BranchCache
	
BranchCache
	allows	data	from	files	and	web	servers	on	a	wide	area	network
(WAN)	to	be	cached	on	computers	at	a	local	branch	office.	By	using	BranchCache,	you	can
improve	application	response	times	while	also	reducing	WAN	traffic.	Cached	data	can	be
either	distributed	across	peer	client	computers	(distributed	cache	mode)	or	centrally	hosted	on
a	server	(hosted	cache	mode).	BranchCache	is	included	with	Windows	Server	2016	and
Windows	10.
Containers
	Windows	Server	2016	has	started	focusing	on	an	isolated	operating	system
environment	called	Dockers.	Dockers	allow	applications	to	run	in	isolated	environments
called	Containers.	Containers	are	a	separate	location	where	applications	can	operate	without
affecting	other	applications	or	other	operating	system	resources.	To	understand	Dockers	and
Containers,	think	of	virtualization.
Virtual	machines	are	operating	systems	that	run	in	their	own	space	on	top	of	another	operating
system.	Well	Dockers	and	Containers	allow	an	application	to	run	in	its	own	space	and	because
of	this,	it	doesn’t	affect	other	applications.	There	are	two	different	types	of	containers	to	focus
on.
Windows	Server	Containers
	Windows	Server	2016	allows	for	an	isolated	application	to
run	by	using	a	technology	called	process	and	namespace	isolation.	Windows	Server	2016
containers	allow	applications	to	share	the	system’s	kernel	with	their	container	and	all	other
containers	running	on	the	same	host.
Hyper-V	Containers
	Windows	Server	2016	Hyper-V	Containers	add	another	virtual	layer
by	isolating	applications	in	their	own	optimized	virtual	machine.	Hyper-V	Containers	work
differently	than	Windows	Server	Containers	in	the	fact	that	the	Hyper-V	Containers	do	not
share	the	system’s	kernel	with	other	Hyper-V	Containers.
Credential	Guard
	Credential	Guard	helps	protect	a	system’s	credentials	and	this	helps	avoid
pass	the	hash	attacks.	Credential	Guard	offers	better	protection	against	advanced	persistent
threats	by	protecting	credentials	on	the	system	from	being	stolen	by	a	compromised
administrator	or	malware.
Credential	Guard	can	also	be	enabled	on	Remote	Desktop	Services	servers	and	Virtual
Desktop	Infrastructure	so	that	the	credentials	for	users	connecting	to	their	sessions	are
protected.
DHCP
	
Dynamic	Host	Configuration	Protocol	(DHCP)
	is	an	Internet	standard	that	allows
organizations	to	reduce	the	administrative	overhead	of	configuring	hosts	on	a	TCP/IP-based
network.	Some	of	the	features	are	DHCP	failover,	policy-based	assignment,	and	the	ability	to

use	Windows	PowerShell	for	DHCP	Server.
DNS
	
Domain	Name	System	(DNS)
	services	are	used	in	TCP/IP	networks.	DNS	will	convert	a
computer	name	or	fully	qualified	domain	name	(FQDN)	to	an	IP	address.	DNS	also	has	the
ability	to	do	a	reverse	lookup	and	convert	an	IP	address	to	a	computer	name.	DNS	allows	you
to	locate	computers	and	services	through	user-friendly	names.
Failover	Clustering
	
Failover	Clustering
	gives	an	organization	the	ability	to	provide	high
availability	and	scalability	to	networked	servers.	Failover	clusters	can	include	file	share
storage	for	server	applications,	such	as	Hyper-V	and	Microsoft	SQL	Server,	and	those	that	run
on	physical	servers	or	virtual	machines.
File	Server	Resource	Manager
	
File	Server	Resource	Manager
	is	a	set	of	tools	that	allows
administrators	to	manage	and	control	the	amount	and	type	of	data	stored	on	the	organization’s
servers.	By	using	File	Server	Resource	Manager,	administrators	have	the	ability	to	set	up	file
management	tasks,	use	quota	management,	get	detailed	reports,	set	up	a	file	classification
infrastructure,	and	configure	file-screening	management.
Group	Policy	Objects
	
Group	Policy	Objects
	are	a	set	of	rules	and	management	configuration
options	that	you	can	control	through	the	Group	Policy	settings.	These	policy	settings	can	be
placed	on	users’	computers	throughout	the	organization.
Hyper-V
	
Hyper-V
	is	one	of	the	most	changed	features	in	Windows	Server	2016.	Hyper-V
allows	an	organization	to	consolidate	servers	by	creating	and	managing	a	virtualized
computing	environment.	It	does	this	by	using	virtualization	technology	that	is	built	into
Windows	Server	2016.
Hyper-V	allows	you	to	run	multiple	operating	systems	simultaneously	on	one	physical
computer.	Each	virtual	operating	system	runs	in	its	own	virtual	machine	environment.
Windows	Server	2016	Hyper-V	now	allows	an	administrator	to	protect	their	corporate	virtual
machines	using	the	new	feature	called	Shielded	Virtual	Machine.	Shielded	Virtual	Machines
are	encrypted	using	BitLocker	and	the	VMs	can	only	run	on	approved	Hyper-V	host	systems.
Hyper-V	also	now	includes	a	new	feature	called	containers.	Containers	add	a	new	unique
additional	layer	of	isolation	for	a	containerized	applications.
IPAM
	
IP	Address	Management	(IPAM)
	is	one	of	the	features	introduced	with	Windows	Server
2012.	IPAM	allows	an	administrator	to	customize	and	monitor	the	IP	address	infrastructure	on
a	corporate	network.
Kerberos	Authentication
	Windows	Server	2016	uses	the	
Kerberos	authentication
	(version
5)	protocol	and	extensions	for	password-based	and	public	key	authentication.	The	Kerberos
client	is	installed	as	a	
security	support	provider	(SSP)
,	and	it	can	be	accessed	through	the
Security	Support	Provider	Interface	(SSPI)
.
Managed	Service	Accounts	(gMSAs)
	Stand-alone	
group	managed	service	accounts
,
originally	created	for	Windows	Server	2008	R2	and	Windows	7,	are	configured	domain
accounts	that	allow	automatic	password	management	and	
service	principal	names	(SPNs)

management,	including	the	ability	to	delegate	management	to	other	administrators.	Service
accounts	are	accounts	that	an	administrator	creates	so	that	the	account	can	be	used	to	start	a
service.	Managed	service	accounts	are	accounts	that	are	created	using	PowerShell,	and	then
Active	Directory	manages	the	account.	This	includes	changing	the	password	on	a	regular
frequency.
Nano	Server
	Windows	Server	2016	has	introduced	a	brand-new	type	of	server	installation
called	Nano	Server.	Nano	Server	allows	an	administrator	to	remotely	administer	the	server
operating	system.	It	was	primarily	designed	and	optimized	for	private	clouds	and	datacenters.
Nano	Server	is	very	similar	to	Server	Core,	but	the	Nano	Server	operating	system	uses
significantly	less	hard	drive	space,	has	no	local	logon	capability,	and	only	supports	64-bit
applications	and	tools.
Nested	Virtualization
	Windows	Server	2016	introduces	a	new	Hyper-V	feature	called	Nested
Virtualization.	Nested	Virtualization	allows	administrators	to	create	virtual	machines	within
virtual	machines.	As	an	instructor,	I	think	this	is	an	awesome	new	feature.	Now	I	can	build	a
Windows	Server	2016	Hyper-V	server	with	a	training	virtual	machine.	Then	when	I	get	to	the
part	when	I	need	to	teach	Hyper-V,	I	can	just	do	that	right	in	the	classroom	virtual	machine.
There	are	numerous	possibilities	and	we	will	talk	more	about	them	throughout	this	book.
Networking
	There	are	many	networking	technologies	and	features	in	Windows	Server	2016,
including	BranchCache,	Data	Center	Bridging	(DCB),	NIC	Teaming,	and	many	more.
PowerShell	Direct
	Windows	Server	2016	includes	a	new	simple	way	to	manage	Hyper-V
virtual	machines	called	PowerShell	Direct.	PowerShell	Direct	is	a	new	powerful	set	of
parameters	for	the	PSSession	cmdlet	called	VMName.	This	will	be	discussed	in	greater	detail
in	the	Hyper-V	chapters.
Remote	Desktop	Services
	Before	Windows	Server	2008,	we	used	to	refer	to	this	as	Terminal
Services.	
Remote	Desktop	Services
	allows	users	to	connect	to	virtual	desktops,	RemoteApp
programs,	and	session-based	desktops.	Using	Remote	Desktop	Services	allows	users	to	access
remote	connections	from	within	a	corporate	network	or	from	the	Internet.
Security	Auditing
	
Security	auditing
	gives	an	organization	the	ability	to	help	maintain	the
security	of	an	enterprise.	By	using	security	audits,	you	can	verify	authorized	or	unauthorized
access	to	machines,	resources,	applications,	and	services.	One	of	the	best	advantages	of
security	audits	is	to	verify	regulatory	compliance.
Smart	Cards
	Using	
smart	cards
	(referred	to	as	
two-factor	authentication
)	and	their
associated	
personal	identification	numbers	(PINs)
	is	a	popular,	reliable,	and	cost-effective
way	to	provide	authentication.	When	using	smart	cards,	the	user	not	only	must	have	the
physical	card	but	also	
must	know	the	PIN	to	be	able	to	gain	access	to	network	resources.	This
is	effective	because	even	if	the	smart	card	is	stolen,	thieves	can’t	access	the	network	unless
they	know	the	PIN.
TLS/SSL	(Schannel	SSP)
	
Schannel
	is	a	security	support	provider	(SSP)	that	uses	the	
Secure
Sockets	Layer	(SSL)
	and	
Transport	Layer	Security	(TLS)
	Internet	standard	authentication
protocols	together.	The	Security	Support	Provider	Interface	is	an	API	used	by	Windows

systems	to	allow	security-related	functionality,	including	authentication.
Windows	Deployment	Services
	
Windows	Deployment	Services
	allows	an	administrator	to
install	Windows	operating	systems	remotely.	Administrators	can	use	Windows	Deployment
Services	to	set	up	new	computers	by	using	a	network-based	installation.
Windows	PowerShell	Desired	State	Configuration
	Windows	Server	2016	created	a	new
PowerShell	management	platform	called	Windows	PowerShell	Desired	State	Configuration
(DSC).	DSC	enables	the	deploying	and	managing	of	configuration	data	for	software	services
and	it	also	helps	manage	the	environment	in	which	these	services	run.
DSC	allows	administrators	to	use	Windows	PowerShell	language	extensions	along	with	new
Windows	PowerShell	cmdlets,	and	resources.	DSC	allows	you	to	declaratively	specify	how	a
corporation	wants	their	software	environment	to	be	configured	and	maintained.
DSC	allows	you	to	automate	tasks	like	enabling	or	disabling	server	roles	and	features,	manage
Registry	settings,	manage	files	and	directories,	manage	groups	and	users,	deploy	software,	and
run	PowerShell	scripts	to	just	name	a	few.
Windows	Server	Backup	Feature
	The	
Windows	Server	Backup
	feature	gives	an	organization
a	way	to	back	up	and	restore	Windows	servers.	You	can	use	Windows	Server	Backup	to	back
up	the	entire	server	(all	volumes),	selected	volumes,	the	system	state,	or	specific	files	or
folders.
Planning	the	Windows	Server	2016	Installation
Before	you	install	Windows	Server	2016,	you	must	first	ask	yourself	these	important	questions:
What	type	of	server	do	I	need?	Will	the	server	be	a	domain	controller?	What	roles	do	I	need	to
install	on	this	server?
Once	you	have	figured	out	what	you	need	the	server	to	do,	you	can	make	a	game	plan	for	the
installation.	So,	let’s	start	by	looking	at	some	of	the	server	roles	and	technologies	that	can	be
installed	on	a	Windows	Server	2016	computer.
Server	Roles	in	Windows	Server	2016
When	you	install	Windows	Server	2016,	you	have	to	decide	which	roles	and	features	are	going
to	be	installed	onto	that	server.	This	is	an	important	decision	in	the	computer	world.	Many
administrators	not	only	overuse	a	server	but	also	underutilize	servers	in	their	organization.
For	example,	many	administrators	refuse	to	put	any	other	roles	or	features	on	a	domain
controller.	This	may	not	be	a	good	use	of	a	server.	Domain	controllers	help	authenticate	users
onto	the	network,	but	after	that	the	domain	controllers	are	really	not	very	busy	all	day	long.
Domain	controllers	have	tasks	that	they	must	perform	all	day,	but	the	server	on	which	they
reside	is	not	heavily	used	when	compared	to	a	SQL	Server	machine	or	an	Exchange	mail
server.	This	is	where	monitoring	your	server	can	be	useful.
If	your	domain	controller	is	a	virtual	machine	or	if	you	have	more	than	enough	servers,	then

having	a	domain	controller	with	no	other	applications	on	it	(except	DNS)	may	be	fine.	But	if
servers	are	limited,	then	think	about	putting	other	services	or	applications	on	your	server	if	the
server	can	handle	them.	Just	remember,	some	applications	work	better	on	member	servers	than
on	domain	controllers.	So	before	just	adding	any	application	to	a	domain	controller,	make	sure
you	research	the	application	and	find	out	best	practices.
Now	let’s	take	a	look	at	some	of	the	roles	and	features	you	can	install	onto	a	Windows	Server
2016	machine.	Knowing	the	different	roles	and	features	you	can	install	will	help	you	to	design,
deploy,	manage,	and	troubleshoot	technologies	in	Windows	Server	2016.	
Figure	1.1
	shows	the
Add	Roles	and	Features	Wizard	in	Server	Manager.	It	shows	you	just	some	of	the	roles	that	can
be	installed	on	a	Windows	Server	2016	machine.
FIGURE	1.1
	Available	roles	in	Windows	Server	2016
Roles	and	Features
Many	of	these	roles	were	discussed	in	the	section	“Features	and	Advantages	of	Windows
Server	2016.”	I	include	them	here	again	because	they	are	also	
roles
	that	can	also	be
installed	on	Windows	Server	2016.
The	following	roles	are	available	in	Windows	Server	2016:
Active	Directory	Certificate	Services
	The	AD	CS	server	role	in	Windows	Server	2016
allows	you	to	build	a	PKI	and	provide	public	key	cryptography,	digital	certificates,	and	digital
signature	capabilities	for	your	organization.

Feature
	AD	CS	provides	a	customizable	set	of	services	that	allows	you	to	issue	and
manage	PKI	certificates.	These	certificates	can	be	used	in	software	security	systems	that
employ	public	key	technologies.
Role
	AD	CS	in	Windows	Server	2016	is	the	server	role	that	allows	you	to	build	a	PKI	and
provide	public	key	cryptography,	digital	certificates,	and	digital	signature	capabilities	for
your	organization.
Active	Directory	Domain	Services
	The	AD	DS	server	role	allows	you	to	create	a	scalable,
secure,	and	manageable	infrastructure	for	user	and	resource	management	and	to	provide
support	for	directory-enabled	applications,	such	as	Microsoft	Exchange	Server.
Active	Directory	Federation	Services
	
Active	Directory	Federation	Services	(AD	FS)
provides	Internet-based	clients	with	a	secure	identity	access	solution	that	works	on	both
Windows	and	non-Windows	operating	systems.	AD	FS	gives	users	the	ability	to	do	a	
single
sign-on	(SSO)
	and	access	applications	on	other	networks	without	needing	a	secondary
password.
Active	Directory	Lightweight	Directory	Services
	
Active	Directory	Lightweight	Directory
Services	(AD	LDS)
	is	a	
Lightweight	Directory	Access	Protocol	(LDAP)
	directory	service	that
provides	flexible	support	for	directory-enabled	applications,	without	the	dependencies	and
domain-related	restrictions	of	AD	DS.
Active	Directory	Rights	Management	Services
	Active	Directory	Rights	Management
Services	(AD	RMS)	in	Windows	Server	2016	is	the	server	role	that	provides	you	with
management	and	development	tools	that	work	with	industry	security	technologies	including
encryption,	certificates,	and	authentication	to	help	organizations	create	reliable	information
protection	solutions.
Device	Health	Attestation
	The	Device	Health	Attestation	helps	protect	your	corporate
network	by	verifying	that	client	systems	meet	corporate	policy.	For	example,	you	can	make
sure	that	all	computers	that	connect	to	your	network	have	their	proper	updates,	antivirus,	and
proper	configuration	policies	before	connecting	to	the	network.
DHCP
	
Dynamic	Host	Configuration	Protocol	(DHCP)
	is	an	Internet	standard	that	allows
organizations	to	reduce	the	administrative	overhead	of	configuring	hosts	on	a	TCP/IP-based
network.	Some	of	the	features	are	DHCP	failover,	policy-based	assignment,	and	the	ability	to
use	Windows	PowerShell	for	DHCP	Server.
DNS
	
Domain	Name	System	(DNS)
	services	are	used	in	TCP/IP	networks.	DNS	will	convert	a
computer	name	or	fully	qualified	domain	name	(FQDN)	to	an	IP	address.	DNS	also	has	the
ability	to	do	a	reverse	lookup	and	convert	an	IP	address	to	a	computer	name.	DNS	allows	you
to	locate	computers	and	services	through	user-friendly	names.
Fax	Server
	The	fax	server	allows	you	to	send	and	receive	faxes,	and	it	also	allows	you	to
manage	fax	resources	such	as	jobs,	settings,	reports,	and	fax	devices	on	a	specific	computer	or
on	the	network.
File	and	Storage	Services
	
File	and	Storage	Services
	allows	an	administrator	to	set	up	and

manage	one	or	more	file	servers.	These	servers	can	provide	a	central	location	on	your	network
where	you	can	store	files	and	then	share	those	files	with	network	users.	If	users	require	access
to	the	same	files	and	applications	or	if	centralized	backup	and	file	management	are	important
issues	for	your	organization,	administrators	should	set	up	network	servers	as	a	file	server.
Host	Guardian	Service
	The	Host	Guardian	Service	(HGS)	allows	you	to	have	a	more	secure
environment	for	your	network’s	virtual	machines.	The	HGS	role	provides	the	Attestation	&
Key	Protection	services	that	enable	Guarded	Hosts	to	run	Shielded	virtual	machines.
Hyper-V
	The	Hyper-V	role	allows	administrators	to	create	and	manage	a	virtualized
environment	by	taking	advantage	of	the	technology	built	into	the	Windows	Server	2016
operating	system.	When	an	administrator	installs	the	Hyper-V	role,	all	required	virtualization
components	are	installed.
Some	of	the	required	components	include	the	Windows	hypervisor,	Virtual	Machine
Management	Service,	the	virtualization	WMI	provider,	the	virtual	machine	bus	(VMbus),	the
virtualization	service	provider	(VSP),	and	the	virtual	infrastructure	driver	(VID).
MultiPoint	Services
	MultiPoint	Services	allows	multiple	users,	each	with	their	own
independent	and	familiar	Windows	experience,	to	simultaneously	share	one	computer.
Network	Controller
	The	Network	Controller	provides	the	point	of	automation	needed	for
continual	configuration,	monitoring,	and	diagnostics	of	virtual	networks,	physical	networks,
network	services,	network	topology,	address	management,	and	so	on	within	a	datacenter.
Network	Policy	and	Access	Services
	Use	the	
Network	Policy	and	Access	Services
	server
role	to	install	and	configure	
Network	Policy	Server	(NPS)
,	which	helps	safeguard	the	security
of	your	network.
Print	and	Document	Services
	
Print	and	Document	Services
	allows	an	administrator	to
centralize	print	server	and	network	printer	tasks.	This	role	also	allows	you	to	receive	scanned
documents	from	network	scanners	and	route	the	documents	to	a	shared	network	resource,
Windows	SharePoint	Services	site,	or	email	addresses.	Print	and	Document	Services	also
provides	fax	servers	with	the	ability	to	send	and	receive	faxes	while	also	giving	the
administrator	the	ability	to	manage	fax	resources	such	as	jobs,	settings,	reports,	and	fax
devices	on	the	fax	server.
Remote	Access
	Remote	Access	provides	connectivity	through	DirectAccess,	VPN,	and	Web
Application	Proxies.	DirectAccess	provides	an	Always	On	and	Always	Managed	experience.
Remote	Access	provides	VPN	access	including	site-to-site	connectivity.	Web	Application
Proxies	enable	web-based	applications	from	your	corporate	network	to	client	devices	outside
of	the	corporate	network.	Remote	Access	also	includes	routing	capabilities,	including	Network
Address	Translation	(NAT).
Remote	Desktop	Services
	Remote	Desktop	Services	allows	for	faster	desktop	and
application	deployments	to	any	device,	improving	remote	user	effectiveness	while	helping	to
keep	critical	data	secure.	Remote	Desktop	Services	allows	for	both	a	
virtual	desktop
infrastructure	(VDI)
	and	session-based	desktops,	allowing	users	to	connect	from	anywhere.

Volume	Activation	Services
	Windows	Server	2016	
Volume	Activation	Services
	will	help
your	organization	benefit	from	using	this	service	to	deploy	and	manage	volume	licenses	for	a
medium	to	large	number	of	computers.
Web	Server	(IIS)
	The	
Web	Server	(IIS)
	role	in	Windows	Server	2016	allows	an	administrator
to	set	up	a	secure,	easy-to-manage,	modular,	and	extensible	platform	for	reliably	hosting
websites,	services,	and	applications.
Windows	Deployment	Services
	Windows	Deployment	Services	allows	an	administrator	to
install	a	Windows	operating	system	over	the	network.	Administrators	do	not	have	to	install
each	operating	system	directly	from	a	CD	or	DVD.
Windows	Server	Essentials	Experience
	Windows	Server	Essentials	Experience	allows	an
administrator	to	set	up	the	IT	infrastructure,	and	it	also	provides	powerful	functions	such	as	PC
backups	to	help	protect	your	corporate	data	and	Remote	Web	Access	that	allows	access	to
business	information	from	anywhere	in	the	world.	Windows	Server	Essentials	Experience	also
allows	you	to	easily	connect	to	cloud-based	applications	and	services.
Windows	Server	Update	Services
	
Windows	Server	Update	Services	(WSUS)
	allows
administrators	to	deploy	application	and	operating	system	updates.	By	deploying	WSUS,
administrators	have	the	ability	to	manage	updates	that	are	released	through	Microsoft	Update	to
computers	in	their	network.	This	feature	is	integrated	with	the	operating	system	as	a	server	role
on	a	Windows	Server	2016	system.
Migrating	Roles	and	Features	to	Windows	Server	2016
Once	you	decide	on	which	roles	and	features	you	are	going	to	install	onto	your	Windows
Server	2016	system,	then	you	either	have	to	install	those	roles	and	features	from	scratch	or
migrate	them	from	a	previous	version	of	Windows	server.
Windows	Server	2016	includes	a	set	of	migration	tools	that	administrators	can	use	to	help	ease
the	process	of	migrating	server	roles,	features,	operating	system	settings,	and	data.
Administrators	can	migrate	this	data	from	an	existing	server	that	are	running	Windows	Server
2008	R2,	Windows	Server	2012,	Windows	Server	2012	R2,	or	Windows	Server	2016	to	a
computer	that	is	running	Windows	Server	2016.
Using	Windows	Server	Migration	Tools	to	migrate	roles,	role	services,	and	features	can
simplify	the	deployment	of	new	servers.	You	can	migrate	roles	and	features	on	any	server,
including	Server	Core,	installation	option	of	Windows	Server	2016,	and	virtual	servers.	By
using	Windows	Server	Migration	Tools,	an	administrator	can	reduce	migration	downtime,
increase	the	accuracy	of	the	migration	process,	and	help	eliminate	conflicts	that	could
otherwise	occur	during	the	migration	process.
One	advantage	of	using	the	migration	tools	is	that	most	of	them	support	cross-architecture
migrations	(x86-based	to	x64-based	computing	platforms),	migrations	between	physical	and
virtual	environments,	and	migrations	between	both	the	full	and	Server	Core	installation	options
of	the	Windows	Server	operating	system.	In	Windows	Server	2016,	Windows	Server

Migration	Tools	also	supports	cross-subnet	migrations.
To	use	Windows	Server	Migration	Tools,	the	feature	must	be	installed	on	both	the	source	and
destination	computers.	Windows	Server	Migration	Tools	installation	and	preparation	can	be
divided	into	the	following	stages:
1
.	
Installing	Windows	Server	Migration	Tools	on	destination	servers	that	run	Windows
Server	2016
2
.	
Creating	deployment	folders	on	destination	servers	that	run	Windows	Server	2016	for
copying	to	source	servers
3
.	
Copying	deployment	folders	from	destination	servers	to	source	servers
4
.	
Registering	Windows	Server	Migration	Tools	on	source	servers
If	you	plan	to	use	Windows	Server	Migration	Tools,	you	must	be	a	member	of	the
Administrators	group	on	both	the	source	and	destination	servers	to	install,	remove,	or	set	up
the	tools.
Administrators	can	install	Windows	Server	Migration	Tools	2016	by	using	either	the	Add
Roles	Or	Features	Wizard	in	Server	Manager	or	Windows	PowerShell	deployment	cmdlets	for
Server	Manager.
To	install	Windows	Server	Migration	Tools	on	a	Server	Core	installation	of	Windows	Server
2016,	you	would	complete	the	following	steps:
1
.	
Open	a	Windows	PowerShell	session	by	typing	
powershell.exe
	in	the	current	command
prompt	session	and	then	pressing	Enter.
2
.	
In	the	Windows	PowerShell	session,	install	Windows	Server	Migration	Tools	by	using	the
Windows	PowerShell	
Install-WindowsFeature
	cmdlet	for	Server	Manager.	In	the
Windows	PowerShell	session,	type	the	following,	and	then	press	Enter.	(Omit	the
ComputerName
	parameter	if	you	are	installing	the	Windows	Server	Migration	Tools	on	the
local	server.)

Deciding	Which	Windows	Server	2016	Versions	to	Use
You	may	be	wondering	which	version	of	Windows	Server	2016	is	best	for	your	organization.
After	all,	Microsoft	offers	the	following	six	versions	of	Windows	Server	2016.
 At	the	time	this	book	was	written,	there	were	six	versions	of	Windows	Server
2016.	But	Microsoft	is	always	improving	and	creating	new	versions	of	their	products.	Be
sure	to	check	out	Microsoft’s	website	for	any	other	versions	or	changes.

Windows	Server	2016	Datacenter
	
This	version	is	designed	for	organizations	that	are	looking
to	migrate	to	a	highly	virtualized,	private	cloud	environment.	Windows	Server	2016
Datacenter	has	full	Windows	Server	functionality	with	unlimited	virtual	instances.
Windows	Server	2016	Standard
	
This	version	is	designed	for	organizations	with	physical	or
minimally	virtualized	environments.	Windows	Server	2016	Standard	has	full	Windows	Server
functionality	with	two	virtual	instances.
Windows	Server	2016	Essentials
	
This	version	is	ideal	for	small	businesses	that	have	as	many
as	25	users	and	50	devices.	Windows	Server	2016	Essentials	has	a	simpler	interface	and
preconfigured	connectivity	to	cloud-based	services	but	no	virtualization	rights.
Windows	Hyper-V	Server	2016
	
Microsoft	Hyper-V	Server	2016	has	the	exact	same	Hyper-V
role	components	as	Windows	Server	2016.	Hyper-V	2016	Server	is	a	stand-alone	version	that
has	the	Windows	hypervisor,	the	Windows	Server	driver	model,	and	the	other	virtualization
components	only.	Windows	Hyper-V	Server	2016	allows	you	to	have	a	simple	virtualization
solution	which	allows	you	to	reduce	costs.
Windows	Storage	Server	2016
	
Windows	Storage	Server	2016	is	not	openly	available	for
sale	to	the	general	public.	Windows	Storage	Server	2016	is	only	available	as	an	integrated
hardware	offering	or	as	an	available	field	upgrade	from	your	hardware	manufacturer.
Windows	Storage	Server	2016	fully	supports	upgrades	from	previous	versions.
Windows	MultiPoint	Premium	2016	Server
	
Windows	MultiPoint	Premium	Server	2016	is	a
Stand-Alone	Windows	product	designed	for	environments	that	have	multiple	users
simultaneously	sharing	one	computer.	Windows	MultiPoint	Premium	2016	Server	is	the	same
as	a	Windows	Server	2016	with	Multipoint	Services	Installed.	MultiPoint	Services	allows
multiple	users,	each	with	their	own	independent	and	familiar	Windows	experience	to
simultaneously	share	one	computer.
Once	you	choose	what	roles	are	going	on	your	server,	you	must	then	decide	how	you’re	going
to	install	Windows	Server	2016.	There	are	two	ways	to	install	Windows	Server	2016.	You	can
upgrade	a	Windows	Server	2012	or	Windows	Server	2012	R2	machine	to	Windows	Server
2016,	or	you	can	do	a	clean	install	of	Windows	Server	2016.	If	you	decide	that	you	are	going
to	upgrade,	there	are	specific	upgrade	paths	you	must	follow.
Your	choice	of	Windows	Server	2016	version	is	dictated	by	how	your	current	network	is
designed.	If	you	are	building	a	network	from	scratch,	then	it’s	pretty	straightforward.	Just
choose	the	Windows	Server	2016	version	based	on	your	server’s	tasks.	However,	if	you
already	have	a	version	of	Windows	Server	2012	installed,	you	should	follow	the
recommendations	in	
Table	1.1
,	which	briefly	summarize	the	supported	upgrade	paths	to
Windows	Server	2016.

 If	your	version	of	Microsoft	Windows	Server	is	not	64-bit,	you	can’t	upgrade
to	Windows	Server	2016.
Deciding	on	the	Type	of	Installation
One	of	the	final	choices	you	must	make	before	installing	Windows	Server	2016	is	what	type	of
installation	you	want.	There	are	three	ways	to	install	Windows	Server	2016.
Windows	Server	2016	(Desktop	Experience)
	
This	is	the	version	with	which	most
administrators	are	familiar.	This	is	the	version	that	uses	
Microsoft	Management	Console
(MMC)
	windows,	and	it	is	the	version	that	allows	the	use	of	a	mouse	to	navigate	through	the
installation.
Windows	Server	2016	Server	Core
	
This	is	a	bare-bones	installation	of	Windows	Server
2016.	You	can	think	of	it	this	way:	If	Windows	Server	2016	(Desktop	Experience)	is	a	
top-of-
the-line	luxury	car,	then	Windows	Server	2016	Server	Core	is	the	stripped-down	model	with
no	air-conditioning,	manual	windows,	and	cloth	seats.	It	might	not	be	pretty	to	look	at,	but	it
gets	the	job	done.
Windows	Server	2016	Nano	Server
	
Windows	Server	2016	has	introduced	a	brand	new	type
of	server	installation	called	Nano	Server.	Nano	Server	allows	an	administrator	to	remotely
administer	the	server	operating	system.	It	was	primarily	designed	and	optimized	for	private
clouds	and	datacenters.	Nano	Server	is	very	similar	to	Server	Core,	but	the	Nano	Server
operating	system	uses	significantly	smaller	hard	drive	space,	has	no	local	logon	capability,	and
only	supports	64-bit	applications	and	tools.

 Server	Core
Here	is	an	explanation	of	Server	Core	that	I	have	used	ever	since	it	was	introduced	in
Windows	Server	2008.
I	am	a	
huge
	sports	fan.	I	love	watching	sports	on	TV,	and	I	enjoy	going	to	games.	If	you
have	ever	been	to	a	hockey	game,	you	know	what	a	hockey	goal	looks	like.	Between
hockey	periods,	the	stadium	workers	often	bring	out	a	huge	piece	of	Plexiglas	onto	the	ice.
There	is	a	tiny	square	cut	out	of	the	bottom	of	the	glass.	The	square	is	just	a	bit	
bigger	than
a	hockey	puck	itself.
Now	they	pick	some	lucky	fan	out	of	the	stands,	give	them	a	puck	at	center	ice,	and	then
ask	them	to	shoot	the	puck	into	the	net	with	the	Plexiglas	in	front	of	it.	If	they	get	it	through
that	tiny	little	square	at	the	bottom	of	the	Plexiglas,	they	win	a	car	or	some	such	great
prize.
Well,	Windows	Server	2016	(Desktop	Experience)	is	like	regular	hockey	with	a	net,	and
Windows	Server	2016	Server	Core	is	the	Plexiglas	version.
Server	Core	supports	a	limited	number	of	roles:
Active	Directory	Certificate	Services	(AD	CS)
Active	Directory	Domain	Services	(AD	DS)
Active	Directory	Federation	Services	(AD	FS)
Active	Directory	Lightweight	Directory	Services	(AD	LDS)
Active	Directory	Rights	Management	Services	(AD	RMS)

Failover	Clustering

Network	Load	Balancing
MPIO

Telnet	Server/Client
Windows	Server	Migration	Tools
Windows	PowerShell	4.0
Server	Core	does	not	have	the	normal	Windows	interface	or	GUI.	Almost	everything	has	to	be
configured	via	the	command	line	or,	in	some	cases,	using	the	Remote	Server	Administration
Tools	from	a	full	version	of	Windows	Server	2016.	While	this	might	scare	off	some
administrators,	it	has	the	following	benefits:
Reduced	Management
	
Because	Server	Core	has	a	minimum	number	of	applications	installed,
it	reduces	management	effort.
Minimal	Maintenance
	
Only	basic	systems	can	be	installed	on	Server	Core,	so	it	reduces	the
upkeep	you	would	need	to	perform	in	a	normal	server	installation.
Smaller	Footprint
	
Server	Core	requires	only	1GB	of	disk	space	to	install	and	2GB	of	free
space	for	operations.
Tighter	Security
	
With	only	a	few	applications	running	on	a	server,	it	is	less	vulnerable	to
attacks.
The	prerequisites	for	Server	Core	are	basic.	It	requires	the	Windows	Server	2016	installation
media,	a	product	key,	and	the	hardware	on	which	to	install	it.
After	you	install	the	base	operating	system,	you	use	PowerShell	or	the	remote	administrative
tools	to	configure	the	network	settings,	add	the	machine	to	the	domain,	create	and	format	disks,
and	install	roles	and	features.	It	takes	only	a	few	minutes	to	install	Server	Core,	depending	on

the	hardware.
 Better	Security
When	I	started	in	this	industry	more	than	20	years	ago,	I	was	a	programmer.	I	used	to
program	computer	hospital	systems.	When	I	switched	to	the	networking	world,	I	continued
to	work	under	contract	with	hospitals	and	with	doctors’	offices.
One	problem	I	ran	into	is	that	many	doctors	are	affiliated	with	hospitals,	but	they	don’t
actually	have	offices	within	the	hospital.	Generally,	they	have	offices	either	near	the
hospital	or,	in	some	cases,	right	across	the	street.
Here	is	the	issue:	Do	we	put	servers	in	the	doctors’	offices,	or	do	we	make	the	doctor	log
into	the	hospital	network	through	a	remote	connection?	Doctors’	offices	normally	don’t
have	computer	rooms,	and	we	don’t	want	to	place	a	domain	controller	or	server	on
someone’s	desk.	It’s	just	unsafe!
This	is	where	Windows	Server	2016	Server	Core	can	come	into	play.	Since	it	is	a
slimmed-down	version	of	Windows	and	there	is	no	GUI,	it	makes	it	harder	for	anyone	in
the	office	to	hack	into	the	system.	Also,	Microsoft	has	a	domain	controller	in	Windows
Server	2016	called	a	
read-only	domain	controller	(RODC)
.	As	its	name	suggests,	it	is	a
read-only	version	of	a	domain	controller.
With	Server	Core	and	an	RODC,	you	can	feel	safer	placing	a	server	on	someone’s	desk	or
in	any	office.	Server	Core	systems	allow	you	to	place	servers	in	areas	that	you	would
never	have	placed	them	before.	This	can	be	a	great	advantage	to	businesses	that	have
small,	remote	locations	without	full	server	rooms.
NIC	Teaming
NIC	Teaming
,	also	known	as	
load	balancing	and	failover	(LBFO)
,	gives	an	administrator	the
ability	to	allow	multiple	network	adapters	on	a	system	to	be	placed	into	a	team.	Independent
hardware	vendors	(IHVs)	have	required	NIC	Teaming,	but	until	Windows	Server	2012,	NIC
Teaming	was	
not
	part	of	the	Windows	Server	Operating	System.
To	be	able	to	use	NIC	Teaming,	the	computer	system	must	have	at	least	one	Ethernet	adapter.	If
you	want	to	provide	fault	protection,	an	administrator	must	have	a	minimum	of	two	Ethernet
adapters.	One	advantage	of	Windows	Server	2016	is	that	an	administrator	can	setup	32
network	adapters	in	a	NIC	Team.
NIC	Teaming	is	a	very	common	practice	when	setting	up	virtualization.	It	is	one	way	that	you
can	have	load	balancing	with	Hyper-V.
NIC	Teaming	gives	an	administrator	the	ability	to	allow	a	virtual	machine	to	use	virtual

network	adapters	in	Hyper-V.	The	advantage	of	using	NIC	Teaming	in	Hyper-V	is	that	the
administrator	can	use	it	to	connect	to	more	than	one	Hyper-V	switch.	This	allows	Hyper-V	to
maintain	connectivity	even	if	the	network	adapter	under	the	Hyper-V	switch	gets	disconnected.
An	administrator	can	configure	NIC	Teaming	in	either	Server	Manager	or	PowerShell.
Installing	Windows	Server	2016
In	the	following	sections,	I	am	going	to	walk	you	through	two	different	types	of	installs.	I	will
show	you	how	to	do	a	full	install	of	Windows	Server	2016	Datacenter	(Desktop	Experience),
and	then	I	will	show	you	how	to	install	the	Server	Core	version	of	the	same	software	and	Nano
Server.
 For	these	labs,	I	am	using	the	full	release	of	Windows	Server	2016	Datacenter,
but	you	can	use	Windows	Server	2016	Standard.
Installing	with	the	Desktop	Experience
In	Exercise	1.1,	I	will	show	you	how	to	install	Windows	Server	2016	Datacenter	(Desktop
Experience).	This	installation	will	have	a	Graphical	User	Interface	(GUI)	and	this	means	that
an	administrator	will	be	able	to	control	the	applications	on	the	Desktop	and	the	operating
system	functions	with	a	mouse.
Windows	Installation
At	the	time	of	this	writing,	I	used	the	first	full	release	of	Windows	Server	2016
Datacenter.	For	this	reason,	there	may	be	screens	that	have	changed	somewhat	since	this
book	was	published.

Installing	Windows	Server	2016	Nano	Server
With	the	release	of	Windows	Server	2016,	Microsoft	has	released	a	brand	new	installation
option	called	Nano	Server.	Nano	Server	is	a	version	of	Windows	Server	2016	that	is
controlled	remotely	and	it	was	specifically	designed	to	optimize	the	Windows	Server	for
private	cloud	and	Datacenter	installations.
Windows	Server	2016	Nano	Server	is	a	lot	like	Server	Core	but	the	advantage	is	that	it	is	even
a	smaller	installation	of	the	operating	system.	Nano	Server	has	
NO
	local	logon	or	GUI
capabilities	and	it	will	allow	only	64-bit	applications	and	utilities.
Since	Nano	Server	takes	much	less	hard	drive	space	and	does	not	have	many	of	the	normal
server	components,	its	allows	Nano	Server	to	be	much	faster	when	it	comes	to	setups,	reboots,
and	even	updates.	Nano	Server	is	available	for	both	Standard	and	Datacenter	editions	of
Windows	Server	2016.
When	Microsoft	created	Nano	Server,	they	had	some	very	specific	ideas	of	how	companies
