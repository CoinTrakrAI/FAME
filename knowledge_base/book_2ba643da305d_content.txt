Acknowledgments
Holy cow! Do you know what’s involved in writing a book? The
team of dedicated professionals who helped to create this resource
for you in order to advance your career in project management has
to be the best in the business.
The spark for this effort began with Kenyon Brown, the senior
acquisition editor who assembled this great team. Gary Schwartz
was the development editor who served as a mentor throughout
the process and at times strangely resembled my college
composition professor. His efforts made this tool the very best
product it could be to assist you in passing the CompTIA Project+
exam. Vanina Mangano helped to ensure the technical viability of
this book. Her talents and dedication in the project management
field are globally known, and she is a terrific collaboration partner.
The rest of the production team, led by Dassi Zeidel, ensured that
this text made it into print in a readable form. Thank you all for
your collaborative efforts!
I would also like to acknowledge Kim Heldman, who has been a
professional mentor to me for over a decade. One of the most
courageous leaders I have ever met, Kim got me started down the
path of project management certification, authorship, and
speaking. Kim is one of the great leaders in public sector
information technology. She brings order and structure to a scary
and complex area.
Most importantly, I would like to thank my wife April and my
children Kayla, Marcus, and Adric. They endured the opportunity
costs of building Legos, helping with homework, or watching a
movie throughout this process. The sacrifice in writing this book
was mostly felt by them, and I couldn’t do it without their smiles,
love, and support. If I didn’t have April in my life, my days would
be dull and I wouldn’t have such a cheery audience for life’s little
animations that we share together. She is my best friend forever,
the world’s greatest cheerleader, a creative and talented teacher,
and the model for the person I want to be. I love you all.

Introduction
Welcome to 
CompTIA Project+ Practice Tests
! Project
management is a fast-growing field that seems to be in constant
need of dependable, certified talent. Project managers are needed
in just about every field, including, but not limited to, construction,
engineering, government and civil initiatives, nonprofits,
information technology, logistics, and transportation. Moreover, it
can be mighty handy for those projects in your life such as moving,
putting in a new kitchen, or helping to organize an event for your
local parent-teacher organization. Heck, it was even surprisingly
helpful in writing a book on practice questions for the CompTIA
Project+ exam.
The Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA)
promotes the Project+ exam for people interested in project
management to earn certifications. The exam helps to validate the
various skills, including business and communication skills, that
an individual would need to lead projects confidently toward on-
time and on-budget completion.
The purpose of this book is to help you pass the CompTIA Project+
Exam PK0-004. As you approach the final validation of your
project management knowledge before taking this exam, this book
will help prepare you for the types of questions and content that
you might encounter on the exam itself. Remember, because of the
broad range of knowledge and fields that use project management,
this should not be the only resource you use to prepare for the
exam. It will be important to use study guides and other exam
resources in your studies. The more varied resources to which you
expose yourself, the greater the probability of a successful result on
the exam.
One such resource you should consider is the 
CompTIA Project+
Study Guide: Exam PK0-004
 by Kim Heldman (Sybex, 2017). It
provides a great overview, reference, and additional review
questions as you strive for certification in your project
management career.

How This Book Is Organized
This book consists of four chapters, each based on one of the four
domains in the CompTIA Project+ objectives for the PK0-004
exam. The book also has two chapters that are meant to simulate
the exam based on a variety of the questions from all four domains.
The chapters are organized as follows:
Chapter 1, “Project Basics (Domain 1.0),” covers the basic
concepts of project management, such as project properties,
roles and responsibilities, project phases, cost control,
organizational structures, project schedules, the Agile method
of project management, and human resources and personnel
management.
Chapter 2, “Project Constraints (Domain 2.0),” focuses on the
constraints and influences on a project, as well as risk strategies
and activities.
Chapter 3, “Communication and Change Management (Domain
3.0),” delves into communication method selection, influences
on communication methods, communication triggers and
adaptation to the target audience, change control processes, and
types of organizational change.
Chapter 4, “Project Tools and Documentation (Domain 4.0),”
covers project management tools, project-centric
documentation, and mutual binding documents and
procurement methods.
Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 consist of practice exams, roughly
representing the mix of questions that you will see on the
actual exam from each of the domains. They also carry a
representative time limit so that you can simulate the testing
experience as a part of your preparation.
Each chapter begins with a list of the Project+ objectives that are
covered in that chapter. Remember, however, that each chapter
does not cover the objectives in order, so do not be alarmed as you
encounter each of the objectives in a randomized order.

 The questions included in this book are 
not
 derived
from the actual Project+ exam questions. They serve to provide
exposure to the underlying content and to deliver a comparable
testing vehicle for you to prepare for the exam. It will not be a
useful exercise to memorize the answers to these questions and
assume that doing so will enable you to pass the exam. The
underlying subject matter is the important focus of your studies
so that you will be able to pass the exam.
Congratulations on investing in your career and your future as a
project manager.
