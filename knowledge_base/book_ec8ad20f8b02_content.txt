CHAPTER	1
INTRODUCTION	TO	HACKING
_______________________________________
1.1														Hacking
The	most	fundamental	meaning	of	hacking	is	gaining	unauthorized	access	to	data	in	a
system	or	computer.
Hacking	is	exploiting	security	controls	either	in	a	technical,	physical	or	a	human-based
element.
		
~	Kevin	Mitnick
However,	the	word	“
hacking
”	has	two	definitions.	The	first	definition	refers	to	the
hobby/profession	of	working	with	computers.	The	second	definition	refers	to	modifies
computer	hardware	or	software	in	a	way	that	changes	the	creator’s	original	intent.
It	is	the	art	of	exploiting	computers	to	get	access	to	otherwise	unauthorized	information.
Now	that	the	world	is	using	IT	systems	to	gather,	store	and	manipulate	important
information	there	is	also	a	need	to	make	sure	that	data	is	secure.	However,	no	system	is
without	is	problems.	Holes	are	often	present	within	security	systems	which,	if	exploited,
allow	hackers	to	gain	access	to	this	otherwise	restricted	information.
	
1.2														Hacker
Computer	Hackers	have	been	around	for	so	many	years.	Since	the	Computer	and	Internet
became	widely	used	in	the	World,	We	have	started	to	hear	more	and	more	about	hacking.
As	the	word	‘Hacking’	has	two	meaning,	so	the	word	‘Hacker’	is	a	word	that	has	two
meanings:
Traditionally,	a	Hacker	is	someone	who	likes	to	play	with	Software	or	Electronic	Systems.
Hackers	enjoy	Exploring	and	Learning	how	Computer	systems	operate.	They	love
discovering	new	ways	to	work	electronically.
Recently,	Hacker	has	taken	on	a	new	meaning	that	someone	who	finds	weaknesses	in	a
computer	or	computer	network,	though	the	term	can	also	refer	to	someone	with	an
advanced	understanding	of	computers	and	computer	networks.
Normally,	Hackers	are	people	who	try	to	gain	unauthorized	access	to	your	computer.
With	controversy,	the	term	hacker	is	reclaimed	by	computer	programmers	who	argue	that

someone	breaking	into	computers	is	better	called	a	cracker,	not	making	a	difference
between	computer	criminals	(black	hats)	and	computer	security	experts	(white	hats).	Some
white	hat	hackers	claim	that	they	also	deserve	the	title	hacker,	and	that	only	black	hats
should	be	called	crackers.
If	hackers,	if	anyone	committing	a	criminal	act,	wants	to	reduce	their	risk,	they	obviously
don’t	involve	anybody	else.	The	greater	the	circle	of	people	that	know	what	you’re	doing,
the	higher	the	risk.
	
~	Kevin	Mitnick
	
1.3														Classifications	of	Hacker
There	are	many	more	types	of	hackers	in	the	world	according	to	their	motive	and	type	of
work.	The	following	list	forwards	one	mote	steps	to	better	knowing	hackers.
White	hat	hacker
The	term	“White	hat	hacker”	refers	to	an	ethical	hacker,	or	a	computer	security	expert,
who	specializes	in	penetration	testing	and	in	other	testing	methodologies	to	ensure	the
security	of	an	organization’s	information	systems.	Ethical	hacking	is	a	term	coined	by
IBM	meant	to	imply	a	broader	category	than	just	penetration	testing.	White-hat	hackers
are	also	called	penetration	tester,	sneakers,	red	teams,	or	tiger	teams.	Generally,	White	hat
hackers	or	ethical	hackers	are	the	good	guy	in	the	world	of	hackers.
Black	hat	hacker
A	black	hat	hacker	is	an	individual	with	extensive	computer	knowledge	whose	purpose	is
to	breach	or	bypass	internet	security.	Black	hat	hackers	are	also	known	as	crackers	or
dark-side	hackers.	The	general	view	is	that,	while	hackers	build	things,	crackers	break
things.	They	are	computer	security	hackers	that	break	into	computers	and	networks	or	also
create	computer	viruses.	The	term	“black	hat”	comes	from	old	westerns	where	the	bad
guys	usually	wore	black	hats.
Black	hat	hackers	break	into	secure	networks	to	destroy	data	or	make	the	network
unusable	for	those	who	are	authorized	to	use	the	network.
They	choose	their	targets	using	a	two-pronged	process	known	as	the	“pre-hacking	stage”.
Step	1:	Targeting
Step	2:	Research	and	Information	Gathering
Step	3:	Finishing	the	Attack
Grey	hat	hacker
A	grey	hat	hacker	is	a	combination	of	a	black	hat	and	a	white	hat	hacker.	It	may	relate	to
whether	they	sometimes	arguably	act	illegally,	though	in	good	will,	or	to	show	how	they
disclose	vulnerabilities.	They	usually	do	not	hack	for	personal	gain	or	have	malicious
intentions,	but	may	be	prepared	to	technically	commit	crimes	during	the	course	of	their
technological	exploits	in	order	to	achieve	better	security.

Elite	hacker
A	social	status	among	hackers,	elite	is	used	to	describe	the	most	skilled.	Newly	discovered
activities	will	circulate	among	these	hackers.
Script	kiddie
A	script	kiddie	(or	skiddie)	is	a	non-expert	who	breaks	into	computer	systems	by	using
pre-packaged	automated	tools	written	by	others,	usually	with	little	understanding	of	the
underlying	concept	hence	the	term	script	(i.e.	a	prearranged	plan	or	set	of	activities)	kiddie
(i.e.	kid,	child	an	individual	lacking	knowledge	and	experience,	immature).
Neophyte
A	neophyte,	“n00b”,	or	“newbie”	is	someone	who	is	new	to	hacking	or	phreaking	and	has
almost	no	knowledge	or	experience	of	the	workings	of	technology,	and	hacking.
Blue	hat
A	blue	hat	hacker	is	someone	outside	computer	security	consulting	firms	who	is	used	to
bug	test	a	system	prior	to	its	launch,	looking	for	exploits	so	they	can	be	closed.	Microsoft
also	uses	the	term	BlueHat	to	represent	a	series	of	security	briefing	events.
Hacktivist
A	hacktivist	is	a	hacker	who	utilizes	technology	to	announce	a	social,	ideological,
religious,	or	political	message.	In	general,	most	hacktivism	involves	website	defacement
or	denial-of-service	attacks.
Nation	state
It	refers	to	Intelligence	agencies	and	cyber	warfare	operatives	of	nation	states.
Organized	criminal	gangs
Criminal	activity	carried	on	for	profit.
Bots
Automated	software	tools,	some	freeware,	available	for	the	use	of	any	type	of	hacker.
What	does	it	take	to	become	a	hacker?
Becoming	a	great	hacker	isn’t	easy	and	it	doesn’t	happen	quickly.	Being	creative	helps	a
lot.	There	is	more	than	one	way	a	problem	can	be	solved,	and	as	a	hacker	you	encounter
many	problems.	The	more	creative	you	are	the	bigger	chance	you	have	of	hacking	a
system	without	being	detected.	Another	huge	quality	you	must	have	is	the	will	to	learn
because	without	it,	you	will	get	nowhere.	Remember,	Knowledge	is	power.	Patience	is	also
a	must	because	many	topics	can	be	difficult	to	grasp	and	only	over	time	will	you	master
them.
	
1.4														Famous	Hackers	of	All	Time
Kevin	Mitnick	:	a.k.a	
The	Condor,	The	Darkside	Hacker

Kevin	David	Mitnick
	(born	August	6,	1963)	is	an	American	computer	security	consultant,
author	and	hacker.
He	was	once	the	most	wanted	cybercriminal	in	the	world.	He	had	an	obsession	with
computers	that	escalated	into	a	two	and	half	year	hacking	spree	where	he	stole	millions	of
dollars	of	corporate	secrets	from	IBM,	Motorola,	telecom	companies	and	even	the
National	Defense	warning	system.
At	age	15,	Mitnick	used	social	engineering	and	dumpster	diving	to	bypass	the	punch	card
system	used	in	the	Los	Angeles	bus	system.	After	a	friendly	bus	driver	told	him	where	he
could	buy	his	own	ticket	punch,	he	could	ride	any	bus	in	the	greater	LA	area	using	unused
transfer	slips	he	found	in	the	trash.	Social	engineering	later	became	his	primary	method	of
obtaining	information,	including	user-names	and	passwords	and	modem	phone	numbers.
Mitnick	first	gained	unauthorized	access	to	a	computer	network	in	1979,	at	16,	when	a
friend	gave	him	the	phone	number	for	the	Ark,	the	computer	system	Digital	Equipment
Corporation	(DEC)	used	for	developing	their	RSTS/E	operating	system	software.	He
broke	into	DEC’s	computer	network	and	copied	their	software,	a	crime	he	was	charged
with	and	convicted	of	in	1988.	He	was	sentenced	to	12	months	in	prison	followed	by	three
years	of	supervised	release.	Near	the	end	of	his	supervised	release,	Mitnick	hacked	into
Pacific	Bell	voice	mail	computers.	After	a	warrant	was	issued	for	his	arrest,	Mitnick	fled,
becoming	a	fugitive	for	two	and	a	half	years.
According	to	the	U.S.	Department	of	Justice,	Mitnick	gained	unauthorized	access	to
dozens	of	computer	networks	while	he	was	a	fugitive.	He	used	cloned	cellular	phones	to
hide	his	location	and,	among	other	things,	copied	valuable	proprietary	software	from	some
of	the	country’s	largest	cellular	telephone	and	computer	companies.	Mitnick	also
intercepted	and	stole	computer	passwords,	altered	computer	networks,	and	broke	into	and
read	private	e-mail.	Mitnick	was	apprehended	on	February	15,	1995,	in	Raleigh,	North
Carolina.	He	was	found	with	cloned	cellular	phones,	more	than	100	clone	cellular	phone
codes,	and	multiple	pieces	of	false	identification.
In	1999,	he	was	convicted	of	various	computer	and	communications-related	crimes.	At	the
time	of	his	arrest,	he	was	the	most-wanted	computer	criminal	in	the	United	States.

Since	2000,	Mitnick	has	been	a	paid	security	consultant,	public	speaker	and	author.	He
does	security	consulting	for	Fortune	500	companies,	performs	penetration	testing	services
for	the	world’s	largest	companies	and	teaches	Social	Engineering	classes	to	dozens	of
companies	and	government	agencies.
	
Vladimir	Levin	:	a.k.a	
Vova
First	internet	bank	robber
He	is	a	Russian-born	Jewish	individual	famed	for	his	involvement	in	the	attempt	to
fraudulently	transfer	USD	10.7	million	via	Citibank’s	computers.
He	was	delivered	into	U.S.	custody	in	September	1997,	and	tried	in	the	United	States
District	Court	for	the	Southern	District	of	New	York.	In	his	plea	agreement	he	admitted	to
only	one	count	of	conspiracy	to	defraud	and	to	stealing	US$3.7	million.	In	February	1998
he	was	convicted	and	sentenced	to	three	years	in	jail,	and	ordered	to	make	restitution	of
US$240,015.	Citibank	claimed	that	all	but	US$400,000	of	the	stolen	US$10.7	million	had
been	recovered.
In	2005	an	alleged	member	of	the	former	St.	Petersburg	hacker	group,	claiming	to	be	one
of	the	original	Citibank	penetrators,	published	under	the	name	ArkanoiD	a	memorandum
on	popular	Provider.net.ru	website	dedicated	to	telecom	market.	According	to	him,	Levin
was	not	actually	a	scientist	(mathematician,	biologist	or	the	like)	but	a	kind	of	ordinary
system	administrator	who	managed	to	get	hands	on	the	ready	data	about	how	to	penetrate
in	Citibank	machines	and	then	exploit	them.
ArkanoiD	emphasized	all	the	communications	were	carried	over	X.25	network	and	the

Internet	was	not	involved.	ArkanoiD’s	group	in	1994	found	out	Citibank	systems	were
unprotected	and	it	spent	several	weeks	examining	the	structure	of	the	bank’s	USA-based
networks	remotely.	Members	of	the	group	played	around	with	systems’	tools	(e.g.	were
installing	and	running	games)	and	were	unnoticed	by	the	bank’s	staff.	Penetrators	did	not
plan	to	conduct	a	robbery	for	their	personal	safety	and	stopped	their	activities	at	some
time.	One	of	them	later	handed	over	the	crucial	access	data	to	Levin	(reportedly	for	the
stated	$100).
In	2005	an	anonymous	hacker	group	came	claiming	that	they	were	the	ones	truly
responsible	for	the	theft	and	that	they	only	sold	Vladimir	the	data	needed	to	steal	the
money.
	
Gary	Mckinnon	:	a.k.a	
Solo
He	was	known	by	his	Internet	handle,	“Solo.”	Using	that	name,	he	coordinated	what
would	become	the	largest	military	computer	hack	of	all	time.	The	allegations	are	that	he,
over	a	13-month	period	from	February	2001	to	March	2002,	illegally	gained	access	to	97
computers	belonging	to	the	U.S.	Armed	Forces	and	NASA.
He	claimed	that	he	was	only	searching	for	information	related	to	free	energy	suppression
and	UFO	activity	cover-ups.	But	according	to	U.S.	authorities,	he	deleted	a	number	of
critical	files,	rendering	over	300	computers	inoperable	and	resulting	in	over	$700,000	in
damages.
Being	of	Scottish	descent	and	operating	out	of	the	United	Kingdom,	he	was	able	to	dodge
the	American	government	for	a	time.	As	of	today,	he	continues	to	fight	against	extradition
to	the	United	States.
	
Mathew	Bevan	(a.k.a	
Kuji
)	and	Richard	Pryce	(a.k.a	
Datastream	Cowboy
)
This	British	hacking	duo	took	the	U.S.	government	for	a	ride	when	they	attacked	the
Pentagon’s	network	for	several	weeks	in	1994.	They	copied	battlefield	simulations	from
Griffiss	Air	Force	Base	in	New	York,	intercepted	messages	from	U.S.	agents	in	North
Korea,	and	got	access	into	a	Korean	nuclear	facility.	Pryce	was	a	16-year-old	then,	and
Bevan	was	21	(he’s	thought	to	have	been	tutoring	Pryce).
The	hacking	attacks	were	especially	troublesome	for	the	U.S.	government	because	they
couldn’t	tell	if	the	duo	was	using	their	system	to	hack	into	a	South	or	North	Korea	-	if	it

were	North	Korea,	the	attacks	could’ve	been	seen	as	an	act	of	war.	Luckily,	South	Korea
was	the	hackers’	target,	and	after	an	international	investigation,	they	were	arrested	in	the
following	year.
	
Michael	Calce	:	a.k.a	
MafiaBoy
He	was	a	high	school	student	from	West	Island,	Quebec,	who	launched	a	series	of	highly
publicized	denial-of-service	attacks	in	February	2000	against	large	commercial	websites,
including	Yahoo!,	Fifa.com,	Amazon.com,	Dell,	Inc.,	E*TRADE,	eBay,	and	CNN.	He	also
launched	a	series	of	failed	simultaneous	attacks	against	9	of	the	13	root	name	servers.
On	February	7,	2000,	Calce	targeted	Yahoo!	with	a	project	he	named	Rivolta,	meaning
“riot”	in	Italian.	Rivolta	was	a	denial-of-service	attack	in	which	servers	become
overloaded	with	different	types	of	communications	to	the	point	where	they	shut	down
completely.	At	the	time,	Yahoo!	was	a	multibillion	dollar	web	company	and	the	top	search
engine.	Mafiaboy’s	Rivolta	managed	to	shut	down	Yahoo!	for	almost	an	hour.	Calce’s	goal
was,	according	to	him,	to	establish	dominance	for	himself	and	TNT,	his	cybergroup,	in	the
cyberworld.	Buy.com	was	shut	down	in	response.	Calce	responded	to	this	in	turn	by
bringing	down	Ebay,	CNN,	Amazon	and	Dell.com	via	DDoS	over	the	next	week.
In	a	2011	interview,	Calce	tried	to	redeem	his	image	by	saying	that	the	attacks	had	been
launched	unwittingly,	after	inputting	known	addresses	in	a	security	tool	he	had
downloaded	from	a	repository	on	the	now	defunct	file-sharing	platform	Hotline,
developed	by	Hotline	Communications.	Calce	would	then	have	left	for	school,	forgetting
the	application	which	continued	the	attacks	during	most	of	the	day.	Upon	coming	home
Calce	found	his	computer	crashed,	and	restarted	it	unaware	of	what	had	gone	on	during
the	day.	Calce	claimed	when	he	overheard	the	news	and	recognized	the	companies
mentioned	being	those	he	had	inputted	earlier	in	the	day	that	he	“started	to	understand
what	might	have	happened”.
	
Adrian	Lamo	:	a.k.a
	
The	Homeless	hacker
He	was	a	mobile	hacker	who	launched	his	work	from	the	confines	of	Internet	cafes,
libraries	or	coffee	shops.	He	actually	did	it	just	as	a	challenge	and	for	fun,	as	he	would
regularly	break	into	computer	systems	and	then	immediately	tell	the	owner	of	the	network

about	its	vulnerability.	He	even	made	himself	an	expert	by	adding	his	name	to	the
database	of	the	New	York	Times.
Lamo	first	gained	media	attention	for	breaking	into	several	high-profile	computer
networks,	including	those	of	The	New	York	Times,	Yahoo!,	and	Microsoft,	culminating	in
his	2003	arrest.	In	2010,	Lamo	reported	U.S.	soldier	PFC	Bradley	Manning	(now	known
as	Chelsea	Manning)	to	federal	authorities,	claiming	that	Manning	had	leaked	hundreds	of
thousands	of	sensitive	U.S.	government	documents	to	WikiLeaks.	Manning	was	arrested
and	incarcerated	in	the	U.S.	military	justice	system	and	later	sentenced	to	35	years	in
confinement.
	
Jeanson	James	Ancheta	:	a.k.a	
Resilient
He	became	the	first	person	to	be	charged	for	controlling	large	numbers	of	hijacked
computers	or	botnets	on	May	9,	2006.
In	2004	he	started	to	work	with	botnets	rxbot,	a	computer	worm	that	can	spread	his	net	of
infected	computers	which	gave	him	control	to	500,000	computers	including	US	military
computers.
In	November	2005	he	was	captured	in	an	elaborate	sting	operation	when	FBI	agents	lured
him	to	their	local	office	on	the	pretext	of	collecting	computer	equipment.	The	arrest	was
part	of	the	Operation	Bot	Roast.
On	May	9,	2006	Ancheta	pleaded	guilty	to	four	felony	charges	of	violating	United	States
Code	Section	1030,	Fraud	and	Related	Activity	in	Connection	with	Computers.	Ancheta
must	serve	60	months	in	prison,	forfeit	a	1993	BMW	and	more	than	$58,000	in	profit.	He
must	also	pay	restitution	of	$15,000	US	to	the	U.S.	federal	government	for	infecting	the
military	computers.
	
Jonathan	James	:	a.k.a	
c0mrade
He	(December	12,	1983	–	May	18,	2008)	was	an	American	hacker	who	was	the	first
juvenile	incarcerated	for	cybercrime	in	the	United	States.	The	South	Florida	native	was	15
years	old	at	the	time	of	the	first	offense	and	16	years	old	on	the	date	of	his	sentencing.
	


What	is	his	ticket	to	fame?	He	was	convicted	and	sent	to	prison	for	hacking	in	the	United
States–all	while	he	was	still	a	minor.	At	only	fifteen	years	of	age,	he	managed	to	hack	into
a	number	of	networks,	including	those	belonging	to	Bell	South,	Miami-Dade,	the	U.S.
Department	of	Defense,	and	NASA.
Yes,	James	hacked	into	NASA’s	network	and	downloaded	enough	source	code	to	learn
how	the	International	Space	Station	worked.	The	total	value	of	the	downloaded	assets
equaled	$1.7	million.	To	add	insult	to	injury,	NASA	had	to	shut	down	their	network	for
three	whole	weeks	while	they	investigated	the	breach,	which	cost	them	$41,000.
The	story	of	James	has	a	tragic	ending,	however.	In	2007,	a	number	of	high	profile
companies	fell	victim	to	a	massive	wave	of	malicious	network	attacks.	Even	though	James
denied	any	involvement,	he	was	suspected	and	investigated.	In	2008,	James	committed
suicide,	believing	he	would	be	convicted	of	crimes	that	he	did	not	commit.
	
Albert	Gonzalez
He	paved	his	way	to	Internet	fame	when	he	collected	over	170	million	credit	card	and
ATM	card	numbers	over	a	period	of	2	years.	Yep.	That’s	equal	to	a	little	over	half	the
population	of	the	United	States.
He	started	off	as	the	leader	of	a	hacker	group	known	as	ShadowCrew.	This	group	would
go	on	to	steal	1.5	million	credit	card	numbers	and	sell	them	online	for	profit.	ShadowCrew
also	fabricated	fraudulent	passports,	health	insurance	cards,	and	birth	certificates	for
identity	theft	crimes	totaling	$4.3	million	stolen.
The	big	bucks	wouldn’t	come	until	later,	when	Gonzalez	hacked	into	the	databases	of	TJX
Companies	and	Heartland	Payment	Systems	for	their	stored	credit	card	numbers.	In	2010,
Gonzalez	was	sentenced	to	prison	for	20	years	(2	sentences	of	20	years	to	be	served	out
simultaneously).
	
Kevin	Poulsen	:	a.k.a	
Dark	Dante
He	gained	his	fifteen	minutes	of	fame	by	utilizing	his	intricate	knowledge	of	telephone
systems.	At	one	point,	he	hacked	a	radio	station’s	phone	lines	and	fixed	himself	as	the

winning	caller,	earning	him	a	brand	new	Porsche.	According	to	media,	he	was	called	the
“Hannibal	Lecter	of	computer	crime.”
He	then	earned	his	way	onto	the	FBI’s	wanted	list	when	he	hacked	into	federal	systems
and	stole	wiretap	information.	Funny	enough,	he	was	later	captured	in	a	supermarket	and
sentenced	to	51	months	in	prison,	as	well	paying	$56,000	in	restitution.
Like	Kevin	Mitnick,	Poulsen	changed	his	ways	after	being	released	from	prison.	He	began
working	as	a	journalist	and	is	now	a	senior	editor	for	Wired	News.	At	one	point,	he	even
helped	law	enforcement	to	identify	744	sex	offenders	on	MySpace.
	
Anonymous
The	concept	of	being	a	“digital	Robin	Hood”	was	far	from	being	conceived,	but	in	the
computer	age,	it	is	very	likely	that	someone	somewhere	has	bagged	this	title.	A	“hacktivist
group”	called	Anonymous	are	known	with	the	penname	of	being	the	“digital	Robin	Hood”
amongst	its	supporters.	Identified	in	public	by	wearing	a	Guy	Fawkes	Masks,	Anons,	as
they	are	widely	known,	have	publicized	themselves	by	attacking	the	government,	religious
and	corporate	websites.	The	Vatican,	the	FBI,	the	CIA,	PayPal,	Sony,	Mastercard,	Visa,
Chinese,	Israeli,	Tunisian,	and	Ugandan	governments	have	been	amongst	their	targets.
Although,	Anons	have	been	arguing	whether	to	engage	in	a	serious	activism	or	a	mere
entertainment,	many	of	the	group	members	have	clarified	their	intent	which	is	to	attack
internet	censorship	and	control.
Anonymous	originated	in	2003	on	the	imageboard	4chan,	representing	the	concept	of
many	online	and	offline	community	users	simultaneously	existing	as	an	anarchic,	digitized
global	brain.
Beginning	with	2008’s	Project	Chanology—a	series	of	protests,	pranks,	and	hacks
targeting	the	Church	of	Scientology—the	Anonymous	collective	became	increasingly
associated	with	collaborative	hacktivism	on	a	number	of	issues	internationally.	Individuals
claiming	to	align	themselves	with	Anonymous	undertook	protests	and	other	actions
(including	direct	action)	in	retaliation	against	anti-digital	piracy	campaigns	by	motion
picture	and	recording	industry	trade	associations.
In	2012,	Time	called	Anonymous	one	of	the	“100	most	influential	people”	in	the	world.
Anons	have	publicly	supported	WikiLeaks	and	the	Occupy	movement.	Related	groups
LulzSec	and	Operation	AntiSec	carried	out	cyberattacks	on	US	government	agencies,
media,	video	game	companies,	military	contractors,	military	personnel,	and	police
officers,	resulting	in	the	attention	of	law	enforcement	to	the	groups’	activities.	It	has	been
described	as	being	anti-Zionist,	and	has	threatened	to	erase	Israel	from	the	Internet	and
engaged	in	the	“#OpIsrael”	cyber-attacks	of	Israeli	websites	on	Yom	HaShoah	(Holocaust

Remembrance	Day)	in	2013.
	
LulzSec
LulzSec	or	Lulz	Security,	a	high	profile,	Black	Hat	hacker	group,	gained	credentials	for
hacking	into	Sony,	News	International,	CIA,	FBI,	Scotland	Yard,	and	several	noteworthy
accounts.	So	notorious	was	the	group	that	when	it	hacked	into	News	Corporations
account,	they	put	across	a	false	report	of	Rupert	Murdoch	having	passed	away.	While	the
group	claims	to	have	retired	from	their	vile	duties,	the	motto	of	the	group,	“Laughing	at
your	security	since	2011!”	stays	alive.	There	are	assertions	of	the	group	having	hacked
into	the	websites	of	the	newspapers	like	The	Times	and	The	Sun	to	post	its	retirement
news.	Many,	however,	claim	that	this	group	had	taken	it	upon	itself	to	create	awareness
about	the	absence	of	efficient	security	against	hackers.
One	of	the	founders	of	LulzSec	was	a	computer	security	specialist	who	used	the	online
moniker	Sabu.	The	man	accused	of	being	Sabu	has	helped	law	enforcement	track	down
other	members	of	the	organization	as	part	of	a	plea	deal.	At	least	four	associates	of
LulzSec	were	arrested	in	March	2012	as	part	of	this	investigation.	British	authorities	had
previously	announced	the	arrests	of	two	teenagers	they	allege	are	LulzSec	members	T-
flow	and	Topiary.
	
Astra
Astra,	a	Sanskrit	word	for	weapon	was	the	penname	of	a	hacker	who	dealt	in	the	weapon
stealing	and	selling.	A	58-year-old	Greek	Mathematician	hacked	into	the	systems	of
France’s	Dassault	Group,	stole	vulnerable	weapons	technology	data	and	sold	it	to	different
countries	for	five	long	years.	While	the	real	identity	of	the	ASTRA	remains	untraced,
officials	have	said	that	he	had	been	wanted	since	2002.	Astra	sold	the	data	to
approximately	250	people	from	around	the	globe,	which	cost	Dassault	$360	millions	of
damage.
	
1.5														Types	of	hacking	attacks	and	techniques
A	typical	approach	in	a	hacking	attack	on	Internet-connected	system	is:
Network	enumeration:
	Discovering	information	about	the	intended	target.
Vulnerability	analysis:
	Identifying	potential	ways	of	attack.
Exploitation:
	Attempting	to	compromise	the	system	by	employing	the	vulnerabilities
found	through	the	vulnerability	analysis.
In	order	to	do	so,	there	are	several	recurring	tools	of	the	trade	and	techniques	used	by

computer	criminals	and	security	experts.
Security	exploits
A	security	exploit	is	a	prepared	application	that	takes	advantage	of	a	known	weakness.
Common	examples	of	security	exploits	are	SQL	injection,	Cross	Site	Scripting	and	Cross
Site	Request	Forgery	which	abuse	security	holes	that	may	result	from	substandard
programming	practice.	Other	exploits	would	be	able	to	be	used	through	FTP,	HTTP,	PHP,
SSH,	Telnet	and	some	web-pages.	These	are	very	common	in	website/domain	hacking.
Techniques	of	hacking
Vulnerability	scanner
A	vulnerability	scanner	is	a	tool	used	to	quickly	check	computers	on	a	network	for	known
weaknesses.	Hackers	also	commonly	use	port	scanners.	These	check	to	see	which	ports	on
a	specified	computer	are	“open”	or	available	to	access	the	computer,	and	sometimes	will
detect	what	program	or	service	is	listening	on	that	port,	and	its	version	number.	(Note	that
firewalls	defend	computers	from	intruders	by	limiting	access	to	ports/machines	both
inbound	and	outbound,	but	can	still	be	circumvented.)
Password	cracking
Password	cracking	is	the	process	of	recovering	passwords	from	data	that	has	been	stored
in	or	transmitted	by	a	computer	system.	A	common	approach	is	to	repeatedly	try	guesses
for	the	password.
Packet	sniffer
A	packet	sniffer	is	an	application	that	captures	data	packets,	which	can	be	used	to	capture
passwords	and	other	data	in	transit	over	the	network.
Spoofing	attack	(Phishing)
A	spoofing	attack	involves	one	program,	system,	or	website	successfully	masquerading	as
another	by	falsifying	data	and	thereby	being	treated	as	a	trusted	system	by	a	user	or
another	program.	The	purpose	of	this	is	usually	to	fool	programs,	systems,	or	users	into
revealing	confidential	information,	such	as	user	names	and	passwords,	to	the	attacker.
Rootkit
A	rootkit	is	designed	to	conceal	the	compromise	of	a	computer’s	security,	and	can
represent	any	of	a	set	of	programs	which	work	to	subvert	control	of	an	operating	system
from	its	legitimate	operators.	Usually,	a	rootkit	will	obscure	its	installation	and	attempt	to
prevent	its	removal	through	a	subversion	of	standard	system	security.	Rootkits	may

include	replacements	for	system	binaries	so	that	it	becomes	impossible	for	the	legitimate
user	to	detect	the	presence	of	the	intruder	on	the	system	by	looking	at	process	tables.
Trojan	horses
A	Trojan	horse	is	a	program	which	seems	to	be	doing	one	thing,	but	is	actually	doing
another.	A	trojan	horse	can	be	used	to	set	up	a	back	door	in	a	computer	system	such	that
the	intruder	can	gain	access	later.	(The	name	refers	to	the	horse	from	the	Trojan	War,	with
conceptually	similar	function	of	deceiving	defenders	into	bringing	an	intruder	inside.)
Viruses
A	virus	is	a	self-replicating	program	that	spreads	by	inserting	copies	of	itself	into	other
executable	code	or	documents.	Therefore,	a	computer	virus	behaves	in	a	way	similar	to	a
biological	virus,	which	spreads	by	inserting	itself	into	living	cells.	While	some	are
harmless	or	mere	hoaxes	most	computer	viruses	are	considered	malicious.
Worms
Like	a	virus,	a	worm	is	also	a	self-replicating	program.	A	worm	differs	from	a	virus	in	that
it	propagates	through	computer	networks	without	user	intervention.	Unlike	a	virus,	it	does
not	need	to	attach	itself	to	an	existing	program.	Many	people	conflate	the	terms	“virus”
and	“worm”,	using	them	both	to	describe	any	self-propagating	program.
Key	loggers
A	key	logger	is	a	tool	designed	to	record	(‘log’)	every	keystroke	on	an	affected	machine
for	later	retrieval.	Its	purpose	is	usually	to	allow	the	user	of	this	tool	to	gain	access	to
confidential	information	typed	on	the	affected	machine,	such	as	a	user’s	password	or	other
private	data.	Some	key	loggers	uses	virus,	trojan,	and	rootkit-like	methods	to	remain
active	and	hidden.	However,	some	key	loggers	are	used	in	legitimate	ways	and	sometimes
to	even	enhance	computer	security.	As	an	example,	a	business	might	have	a	key	logger	on
a	computer	used	at	a	point	of	sale	and	data	collected	by	the	key	logger	could	be	used	for

catching	employee	fraud.
	
1.6														Password
A	password	is	a	secret	series	of	characters	that	enables	a	user	to	access	a	file,	computer,	or
program.	On	multi-user	systems,	each	user	must	enter	his	or	her	password	before	the
computer	will	respond	to	commands.	The	password	helps	ensure	that	unauthorized	users
do	not	access	the	computer.	In	addition,	data	files	and	programs	may	require	a	password.
Ideally,	the	password	should	be	something	that	nobody	could	guess.	In	practice,	most
people	choose	a	password	that	is	easy	to	remember,	such	as	their	name	or	their	initials.
This	is	one	reason	it	is	relatively	easy	to	break	into	most	computer	systems.
Strong	Password
Strong	Password	refers	to	a	password	that	is	difficult	to	detect	by	both	humans	and
computer	programs,	effectively	protecting	data	from	unauthorized	access.	It	consists	of	at
least	six	characters	(and	the	more	characters,	the	stronger	the	password)	that	are	a
combination	of	letters,	numbers	and	symbols	(@,	#,	$,	%,	etc.)	if	allowed.	Passwords	are
typically	case-sensitive,	so	a	strong	password	contains	letters	in	both	uppercase	and
lowercase.	Strong	passwords	also	do	not	contain	words	that	can	be	found	in	a	dictionary
or	parts	of	the	users	own	name.
Weak	password
A	weak	password	refers	to	a	password	that	is	easy	to	detect	both	by	humans	and	by
computer.	Examples	of	a	weak	password	are	names,	birth	dates,	phone	numbers,	easy
guessable	word,	etc.

WINDOWS	HACKING
____________________________________
2.1														Introduction	to	Windows	Hacking
Windows	hacking	is	the	practice	of	modifying	Windows	Operating	System	to	accomplish
a	goal	outside	of	the	creator’s	original	purpose.	People	who	engage	in	hacking	activities
are	often	called	hackers.	Since	the	word	“hack”	has	long	been	used	to	describe	someone
who	is	incompetent	at	his/her	profession,	some	hackers	claim	this	term	is	offensive	and

fails	to	give	appropriate	recognition	to	their	skills.	Windows	hacking	is	most	common
among	teenagers	and	young	adults,	although	there	are	many	older	hackers	as	well.
	
2.2														Registry	Editor	Related	Hacking
What	is	Windows	Registry?	(Registry	Editor)
Windows	Registry	is	a	database	used	to	store	information	that	is	necessary	to	configure
the	system	for	one	or	more	users,	applications	and	hardware	devices	and	it	keeps	record	of
the	settings	of	all	the	Software	installed	in	Computer	including	Operating	System.
To	open	Registry	Editor
:	
Start	>	All	Programs	>	Accessories	>	Run	>	regedit
Registry	Editor	Window
Windows	Registry	contains	
Five	Hives
	and	hives	contain	
Keys
	and	
Sub	keys
	and	their
respective	Values.
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT:
	The	information	that	is	stored	here	makes	sure	that	the
correct	program	opens	when	you	open	a	file	by	using	Windows	Explorer.
HKEY_CURRENT_USER:
	Contains	the	configuration	information	for	the	user	who	is
currently	logged	on.	The	user’s	folders,	screen	colors,	and	Control	Panel	settings	are
stored	here.
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE:
	Contains	configuration	information	particular	to	the
computer	(for	any	user).
HKEY_USERS:
	Contains	all	the	actively	loaded	user	profiles	on	the	computer.
HKEY_CURRENT_USER	is	a	subkey	of	HKEY_USERS.
HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG:
	Contains	information	about	the	hardware	profile	that	is
used	by	the	local	computer	at	system	startup.
Types	of	Keys
Binary	Value	(REG_BINARY):
	Raw	binary	data.	Most	hardware	component
information	is	stored	as	binary	data	and	is	displayed	in	Registry	Editor	in	hexadecimal
format
DWORD	Value	(REG_DWORD):
	Data	represented	by	a	number	that	is	4	bytes	long	(a
32-bit	integer).	Can	also	contain	binary,	hexadecimal,	or	decimal	format

Expandable	String	Value	(REG_EXPAND_SZ):
	A	variable-length	data	string.	This	data
type	includes	variables	that	are	resolved	when	a	program	or	service	uses	the	data
String	Value	(REG_SZ):
	A	fixed-length	text	string
Multi-String	Value	(REG_MULTI_SZ):
	Values	that	contain	lists	or	multiple	values	in	a
form	that	people	can	read	are	generally	this	type.
Disclaimer:
	Modifying	the	registry	can	cause	serious	problems	that	may	require	you	to
reinstall	your	operating	system.	We	cannot	guarantee	that	problems	resulting	from
modifications	to	the	registry	can	be	solved.	Use	the	information	provided	at	your	own	risk.

Clean	up	the	“Open	With”	Menu	in	Explorer
Have	you	ever	accidently	opened	an	mp3	with	Notepad,	or	a	zip	file	with	Word?		If	so,
you’re	also	likely	irritated	that	these	programs	now	show	up	in	the	Open	with	menu	in

Windows	Explorer	every	time	you	select	one	of	those	files.		Whenever	you	open	a	file
type	with	a	particular	program,	Windows	will	add	an	entry	for	it	to	the	Open	with	menu.	
Usually	this	is	helpful,	but	it	can	also	clutter	up	the	menu	with	wrong	entries.	On	our
computer,	we	have	tried	to	open	a	PDF	file	with	Word	and	Notepad,	neither	which	can
actually	view	the	PDF	itself.		Let’s	remove	these	entries.		To	do	this,	we	need	to	remove
the	registry	entries	for	these	programs.	
1
.	
Enter	
regedit	
in	your	
Start
	menu	search	or	in	the	
Run
	command	to	open	the

Tips:
	Backup	your	registry	first	just	in	case,	so	you	can	roll-back	any	changes	you	make	if
you	accidently	delete	the	wrong	value.

.	
Now,	browse	to	the	following	key:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER	\Software	\Microsoft	\Windows	\CurrentVersion	\
Explorer	\FileExts\
3
.	
Now,	you	will	see	a	list	of	all	the	file	extensions	that	are	registered	on	your	computer.
4
.	
Browse	to	the	file	extension	you	wish	to	edit,	click	the	white	triangle	beside	it	to	see
the	subfolders,	and	select	
OpenWithList
.		In	our	test,	we	want	to	change	the
programs	associated	with	PDF	files,	so	we	select	the	
OpenWithList
	folder	under
.pdf
.
5
.	
Notice	the	names	of	the	programs	under	the	
Data
	column	on	the	right.		
Right-click
the	value	for	the	program	you	don’t	want	to	see	in	the	Open	With	menu	and	select
Delete
.
6
.	
Click	
Yes
	at	the	prompt	to	confirm	that	you	want	to	delete	this	value.
7
.	
Repeat	these	steps	with	all	the	programs	you	want	to	remove	from	this	file	type’s
Open	with	menu.		You	can	go	ahead	and	remove	entries	from	other	file	types	as	well
if	you	wish.
8
.	
Restart	the	computer	and	check	out	the	
Open	with	
menu	in	Explorer	again.		Now	it
will	be	much	more	streamlined	and	will	only	show	the	programs	you	want	to	see.

How	to	Disable	Shutdown,	Restart,	Sleep	and	Hibernate
Someday,	you	might	want	to	make	a	computer	could	not	be	turned	off	easily.	For	example
because	you	are	running	a	program	that	needs	a	long	time	to	wait	(download	a	big	file,
rendering	a	video,	etc.)	and	you	have	to	leave	the	room.	To	prevent	anyone	else	to	turn	off
the	computer,	then	one	way	is	to	disable	the	function	of	Shutdown,	Restart,	Sleep	or
Hibernate	menu.

Use	Pen	drive	to	fast	your	computer	
(Boost	performance	with	
ReadyBoost
)
Windows	7	has	a	feature	called	
ReadyBoost
	which	enables	its	users	to	use	their	pen
drives	as	temporary	RAM	for	their	systems.	This	feature	is	helpful	when	because	of	any
reason	you	need	to	speed	up	your	system	for	short	time.	Instructions	to	do	this	are	given
below:
1
.	
Insert	a	
Pen	Drive
/USB	drive	in	the	USB	port.
2
.	
Open	
My	Computer
.
3
.

	on	the	icon	of	the	newly	inserted	
USB	drive
	and	select	
Properties
.
4
.	
In	the	
Removable	Disk	Properties
	dialog-box	go	to	
ReadyBoost
	tab.

5
.	
If	you	want	to	dedicate	the	entire	space	of	your	pen	drive	for	
ReadyBoost
	you	can
select	the	radio	button	that	says	
Dedicate	this	device	to	ReadyBoost
.	Alternatively
you	can	dedicate	any	specified	amount	of	space	from	the	pen	drive	for	ReadyBoost.
To	do	this	you	can	select	
Use	this	device
	radio	button	and	in	the	text	box	you	can

RAM.

configurations.
More	Info:	
When	ReadyBoost	is	enabled	a	file	named	
ReadyBoost.sfcache
	is	created.
This	file	is	compressed	and	encrypted	so	that	even	if	anyone	steals	the	pen	drive,	the	thief
cannot	read	data	the	pen	drive	contains.
Recommendations:	
Don’t	pull	flash	drive	out	of	USB	Port	while	it	is	being	used	as	a
ReadyBoost	device.	Don’t	save	any	data	files	on	the	flash	drive	when	it	is	being	used	as

password
	before	allowing	you	read-only	access	to	your	flash	drive.	You	can	even	use	the
drive	on	older	computers	running	Windows	XP/Vista.

Steganography	–	Hide	a	text	behind	an	image
Steganography	is	the	art	and	science	of	hiding	messages.	Steganography	is	often
combined	with	cryptography	so	that	even	if	the	message	is	discovered	it	cannot	be	read.
The	word	steganography	is	derived	from	the	Greek	words	“steganos”	and	“graphein”,
which	mean	“covered”	and	“writing.”	Steganography,	therefore,	is	covered	writing.
Historical	steganography	involved	techniques	such	as	disappearing	ink	or	microdots.
Modern	steganography	involves	hiding	data	in	computer	files.	It	is	fairly	easy	to	hide	a
secret	message	in	a	graphic	file	without	obviously	altering	the	visible	appearance	of	that
file.
To	hide	a	text	behind	an	image:
To	hide	a	file	behind	a	image	file	which	means	that	if	any	one	opens	that	image	he	will	see
the	image	only	but	if	you	open	in	a	special	way	then	you	can	open	the	hidden	file	behind
the	image.

The	Show	desktop	button	has	been	moved	the	opposite	end	of	the	taskbar	from	the	Start
button,	making	it	easier	to	click	or	point	at	the	button	without	accidentally	opening	the

Start	menu.
In	addition	to	clicking	the	Show	desktop	button	to	get	to	the	desktop,	you	can	temporarily
view	or	peek	at	the	desktop	by	just	pointing	your	mouse	at	the	Show	desktop	button.
When	you	point	at	the	Show	desktop	button	at	the	end	of	the	taskbar,	any	open	windows
fade	from	view,	revealing	the	desktop.	To	make	the	windows	reappear,	move	the	mouse
away	from	the	Show	desktop	button.
Quickly	view	your	desktop	using	Peek
This	can	be	useful	for	quickly	viewing	desktop	gadgets,	or	when	you	don’t	want	to
minimize	all	open	windows	and	then	have	to	restore	them.
Peek	at	an	open	file	on	the	desktop
You	can	also	use	Aero	Peek	to	take	a	quick	look	at	other	open	windows	without	clicking
away	from	the	window	you	are	currently	working	on.
Peek	at	open	window	using	thumbnails	on	the	taskbar
Point	your	mouse	at	a	program	icon	on	the	taskbar	that	has	open	files.	Thumbnail
previews	of	any	open	files	associated	with	that	program	appear	above	the	taskbar.	You	can
point	at	a	thumbnail	to	preview	that	window’s	contents,	and	all	the	other	open	windows	on
the	desktop	fade	away	to	reveal	just	the	window	you’re	previewing.	To	open	the	window
you’re	previewing,	click	the	thumbnail.
	
Change	how	icons	appear	on	the	taskbar
You	can	customize	the	taskbar,	including	the	appearance	of	icons	and	how	they	group
together	when	you	have	multiple	items	open.	Here	are	your	choices:
Always	combine,	hide	labels
This	is	the	default	setting.	Each	program	appears	as	a	single,	unlabeled	icon,

even	when	multiple	items	for	a	program	are	open.
A	single	icon	represents	both	a	program	and	open	items
Combine	when	taskbar	is	full
This	setting	shows	each	item	as	an	individual,	labeled	icon.	When	the	taskbar
becomes	crowded,	programs	with	multiple	open	items	collapse	into	a	single
program	icon.	Clicking	the	icon	displays	a	list	of	the	items	that	are	open.	Both
this	setting	and	Never	combine	resemble	the	look	and	behavior	of	earlier
versions	of	Windows.
Individually	labeled	icons	combine	when	the	taskbar	is	full
Never	combine
This	setting	is	similar	to	Combine	when	taskbar	is	full,	except	icons	never
collapse	into	a	single	icon,	regardless	of	how	many	windows	are	open.	As
more	programs	and	windows	open,	icons	decrease	in	size	and	eventually	scroll
within	the	taskbar.
Individually	labeled	icons	always	appear

Pin	any	item	to	the	Windows	7	taskbar
You	can	pin	your	favorite	applications	or	files	so	that	you	could	open	them	quickly	from
any	window	at	any	time.	In	Windows	7,	you	can	pin	shortcuts	for	favorite	or	frequently
used	files,	folders,	and	websites	to	the	Jump	Lists	for	each	of	those	programs	to	the
taskbar.
To	pin	a	program	shortcut	to	the	taskbar,	do	one	of	the	following:

If	the	program	is	already	running,	
right-click
	the	program’s	button	on	the	taskbar	(or
drag	the	button	toward	the	desktop)	to	open	the	program’s	Jump	List,	and	then	click
Pin	this	program	to	taskbar
.
If	the	program	isn’t	running,	click	
Start
,	find	the	program’s	icon,	
right-click
	the
icon,	and	then	click	
Pin	to	Taskbar
.
You	can	also	pin	a	program	by	dragging	the	program’s	shortcut	from	the	
Desktop
	or
Start
	menu	to	the	taskbar.
Example	of	dragging	and	pin:
	Pin	a	program	from	desktop	(Left)	:	Pin	a	program	from
Start	menu	(Right)
	
Pin	Control	Panel	to	the	Taskbar


You	cannot	pin	the	Control	Panel	to	the	taskbar	via	the	Start	Menu	or	by	drag	and	drop.
Open	the	Control	Panel	and	right-click	its	taskbar	icon	to	pin	it	to	the	taskbar.	An
advantage	of	this	is	that	Control	Panel’s	Jump	List	allows	quick	access	to	recently	used
functions.
	
Windows	7	Taskbar	icons	appears	in	the	center	of	the	taskbar
Everything	that	comes	out	of	the	box	by	default	lacks	the	ability	to	re-adjust.	Windows	7
Taskbar	is	the	single	biggest	feature	of	Windows	7	and	yet,	you	can’t	do	much	about	it
other	than	re-arrange	the	icon	in	order.	Also,	by	default	the	icons	will	always	be	aligned	to
the	left,	what	if	you	want	to	make	them	align	to	the	center	or	even	right?

Simple	Steps	to	Protecting	Your	Computer
Hackers	have	thousands	of	tools	at	their	disposal	to	take	advantage	of	you	including	tools
such	as	keystroke	loggers.	Keystroke	loggers	record	every	single	keystroke	you	type	on
your	computer;	this	includes	your	private	email	messages,	your	bank	account	password,
and	your	credit	card	number.	This	article	focuses	on	Microsoft	Windows	users	since	the
majority	of	computer	users	today	use	a	version	of	this	operating	system	on	their	home
and/or	office	computers.
1
.	
Use	Strong	passwords.
2
.	
Update	your	computer	to	latest	Operating	System	(e.g.	Windows	7	or	8)
3
.	
Update	Microsoft	Windows	regularly.
4
.	
Turn	on	Windows	firewall.

5
.	
Use	antivirus	software	or	internet	security	to	protect	your	computer	from	virus.	(e.g.
AVG	anti-virus/internet	security,	Norton	Antivirus,	McAfee	VirusScan,	Kaspersky,
etc.)
6
.	
Block	Spyware	-	Spyware	and	viruses	often	go	hand-in-hand	but	can	take	many
forms.	Some	‘hijack’	your	web	browser	and	redirects	you	to	their	website.	Others
quietly	download	and	install	Trojans,	key	logger	programs,	etc.	to	your	computer	so
hackers	can	take	control	of	your	computer	later.	Install	and	run	an	anti-spyware
program	such	as:	Spy	Sweeper,	Ad-aware	SE	Personal
7
.	
Keep	your	software	up-to-date.	(e.g.	Microsoft	Office,	Adobe	Rader,	Adobe	Flash
Player,	Mozilla	Firefox,	Anti-virus,	etc.,)
8
.	
Backup	your	important	data	often.

CHAPTER	3
INTERNET	HACKING
_______________________________________
3.1														Introduction	to	Internet	Hacking
Internet	hacking	means	accessing	a	secure	computer	system	by	disabling	or	bypassing	the
security.	Some	hackers	will	steal	data	or	destroy	data,	or	use	the	system	to	hide	their
tracks	as	they	hack	into	a	different	system	and	some	just	do	it	for	fun.	Like	most	cases	of
extortion,	the	criminal’s	identity	is	especially	difficult	to	trace	and	is	magnified	because	of
the	nature	of	the	internet.	When	the	Internet	was	gaining	immense	popularity,	businesses
were	scrambling	to	secure	domain	names	and	using	the	technology	to	expand	their
market.	Seeing	e-commerce	as	an	untapped	goldmine,	many	were	eagerly	diving	headfirst
into	a	slew	of	problems,	including	security	breaches.	Viruses,	shutdowns,	crashes	and
email	hacking	will	be	the	burden	of	the	user,	a	company’s	money	lost	to	theft	will	be	the
burden	of	its	customers	and	a	government’s	money	spent	on	security	will	be	the	burden	of
its	citizens.
	
3.2														Block	and	unblock	any	website
First	you	have	to	show	all	hidden	files,	folders,	and	drives	on	your	computer.
Go	to	
My	Computer	>	Tools	>	View
Click	on	the	
Show	hidden	files,	folders,	and	drives
	button.

Then	Click	
OK
.
Then	do	the	followings:
1
.	
Click	
Start	>	All	Programs	>	Accessories	>	
Right	Click	on
	Notepad	
and	click	on
Run	as	administrator
2
.	
Then	in	
Untitled	-	Notepad
	window	click	
File	>	Open
	(in	
Menu	bar
).	
Open
dialog-box	will	appear.
3
.	
Navigate	to		-	
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc
4
.	
Then	select	
All	Files	
next	to	the	
File	name
	field.	(By	selecting	
All	Files
	option	all
files	are	shown	as	shown	in	the	below	figure.)
5
.	
Click	
host
	and	click	
Open
.	Then	the	notepad	is	seems	to	be	like	in	below	picture.
6
.	
Now	add	a	new	entry	in	the	bottom,	let	you	want	to	block	www.facebook.com.then
add	the	line	
127.0.0.1		www.facebook.com

7
.	
This	line	means	that	when	you	try	to	open	the	www.facebook.com,then	it	is
redirected	to	IP	Address	127.0.0.1,	which	is	a	back	IP	of	the	windows.
8
.	
Save	the	file	(by	pressing	
Ctrl	+	S
)	and	restart	the	computer.	Then
www.facebook.com
	is	block	for	all	browsers.
9
.	
To	unblock	it,	remove	the	entry,	which	you	have	made	and	Save	the	file.	Then	restart
the	computer.
Tips:	
This	method	works	for	all	browsers.
Note:	
You	can	bypass	registration	of	software	by	blocking	their	website	and	update
requests	using	this	trick.
	
3.3														How	to	Increase	Internet	Speed

3.6														View	Passwords	hidden	in	asterisks
	
We	always	want	the	browsers	to	remember	the	username	and	password	of	our	online
accounts.	After	a	period	of	time,	we	tend	to	forget	what	the	password	was.		It	is	easy	to
find	those	passwords,	if	we	are	able	to	see	what	is	behind	the	black	dots	(……..)	or
asterisks	(*******).	To	know	the	password	behind	the	dots	then	follow	the	steps:
	
1
.	
Right	click	on	the	password	textbox	and	from	the	options	click	on	
Inspect
Element(Q)
.

3.7														How	to	speedup	online	videos	and	performance	of	Firefox
By	default	Firefox	automatically	saves	your	session	every	10	seconds	so	that	it	can	be
easily	restored	even	of	a	crash.	But	if	you	think	10	seconds	is	either	too	much	or	is	not
enough,	then	you	can	change	it	to	whatever	you	think	is	right	for	you,	with	just	a	little
tweak	to	the
	
about:config
	settings.	To	do	this,
1
.	
Open	
Mozilla	Firefox
	browser	and	in	the	address	bar	type	
about:config
	and	press
Enter
.
2
.	
Then	you	will	get	a	warning	message,	click	on	
I’ll	be	careful,	I	promise
.
3
.	
Then	in	the	filter	text	entry	bar	(on	top	left),	type	
browser.sessionstore.interval
4
.	
Just	double	click	on	it	and	change	its	value	to	
120000.	
If	you	want	to	input	your	own
value,	then	you	should	know	that	the	value	is	actually	in	milliseconds.	So,	if	you
want	to	change	the	interval	to	1	minute,	then	you	would	enter	
60000
.
5
.	
Click	
OK
	and	restart	the	Firefox.

	
3.8														Sign-out	of	all	Gmail	sessions
If	you	have	forgotten	to	sign-out	from	your	Gmail	account	anywhere,	you	can	now	sign-
out	from	all	Gmail	sessions.	To	do	this,
1
.	
Open	your	
Gmail	
account	and	click	on	the	
Details
	link	in	the	bottom	right	of	your
screen.
2
.	
This	will	open	up	a	pop	up	window	where	you	can	see	recent	activity,	whether	your
Gmail	account	is	open	in	any	other	location,	and	choose	to	
Sign	out	of	all	other
sessions
.
3
.	
Clicking	that	button	will	ensure	all	your	previous	Gmail	sessions	are	logged	out,
leaving	you	logged	in	to	the	current	computer	only.

3.9														Sign-in	to	multiple	Google	accounts	in	the	same	browser
If	you	use	multiple	Google	accounts	say	one	for	Gmail	another	for	ad-sense	and	yet
another	for	Reader,	you	would	know	that	you	can	sign	into	only	one	account	at	a	time	in	a
