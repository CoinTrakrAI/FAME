Introduction
Welcome to 
CompTIA Network+ Practice Tests: Exam N10-007.
 This
book gives you a focused, timesaving way to review your networking
knowledge and prepare to pass the Computing Technology Industry
Association (CompTIA) Network+ exam. The book combines realistic
exam prep questions with detailed answers and two complete practice
tests to help you become familiar with the types of questions that you
will encounter on the Network+ exam. By reviewing the objectives and
sample questions, you can focus on the specific skills that you need to
improve before taking the exam.

How This Book Is Organized
The first five chapters of this book are based on the five objective
domains published by CompTIA for the N10-007 Network+ exam.
There are 200 questions for each objective domain, broken down into
the individual subdomains and covering each of the suggested topics.
The next two chapters each contain a 100-question practice test
covering all of the objective domains. Once you have prepared each of
the objective domains individually, you can take the practice tests to
see how you will perform on the actual exam.
Interactive Online Learning 
Environment and Test Bank
The interactive online learning environment that accompanies
CompTIA Network+ Practice Tests: Exam N10-007
 provides a test
bank with study tools to help you prepare for the certification exam,
and increase your chances of passing it the first time. The online test
bank runs on multiple devices. The test bank includes the following:
Chapter Tests
 The questions in the chapters align with objectives
in the exam outline. Use these questions to test your knowledge.
Practice Exams
 Two practice exams are provided to prepare you
for the type of questions to expect on the actual exam.
Go to 
http://www.wiley.com/go/netplustestprep
 to
register and gain access to this interactive online learning
environment and test bank with study tools.
Who Should Read This Book
CompTIA recommends, but does not require, that candidates for the
Network+ exam meet the following prerequisites:

CompTIA A+ certification or equivalent knowledge
At least 9 to 12 months of work experience in IT networking
CompTIA’s certification program relies on exams that measure your
ability to perform a specific job function or set of tasks. CompTIA
develops the exams by analyzing the tasks performed by people who
are currently working in the field. Therefore, the specific knowledge,
skills, and abilities relating to the job are reflected in the certification
exam.
Because the certification exams are based on real-world tasks, you
need to gain hands-on experience with the applicable technology in
order to master the exam. In a sense, you might consider hands-on
experience in an organizational environment to be a prerequisite for
passing the Network+ exam. Many of the questions relate directly to
specific network products or technologies, so use opportunities at your
school or workplace to practice using the relevant tools. Candidates for
the exam are also expected to have a basic understanding of enterprise
technologies, including cloud and virtualization.
How To Use This Book
Although you can use this book in a number of ways, you might begin
your studies by taking one of the practice exams as a pretest. After
completing the exam, review your results for each Objective Domain
and focus your studies first on the Objective Domains for which you
received the lowest scores.
As this book contains only practice questions and answers, the best
method to prepare for the Network+ exam is to use this book along
with a companion book that provides more extensive explanations for
the elements covered in each objective domain. Todd Lammle’s
CompTIA Network+ Study Guide: Exam N10-007
 provides complete
coverage of all the technology you need to know for the exam.
After you have taken your pretest, you can use the chapters for the
objective domains in which you need work to test your detailed
knowledge and learn more about the technologies involved. By
reviewing why the answers are correct or incorrect, you can determine

if you need to study the objective topics more.
What’s Next
The next step is to review the objective domains for the Network+
N10-007 exam and think about which topics you need to work on
most. Then, you can turn to the appropriate chapter and get started.
Good luck on the exam.

Ralph has been hired to connect three local area networks (LANs)
together with redundant paths that form a fault-tolerant backbone.
The LANs reside on different floors in the same building and are
approximately 600 meters apart. Each LAN is currently configured
in a star topology using twisted pair cabling. Each LAN includes
wall plates and rack-mounted patch panels and switches. Building
and fire codes allow cables to run through existing risers, ceilings,
and walls, but a 50,000-watt radio station occupies one of the
floors between the LANs. Which topology, cable type, and
installation method is best suited for this network?
A

Alice is a network consultant who has been contracted to evaluate a
network design created many years ago by another consultant. The

client wants to know if the design is still viable. The network is to
be installed in a large factory that needs 20 workstations, scattered
throughout the building, to run an inventory database application.
The two most distant computers are 150 meters apart. The primary
goal for the network design is to connect all 20 workstations to a
single local area network (LAN) running at 10 megabits per second
(Mbps). The two secondary goals are to provide sufficient fault
tolerance for a single cable break to occur without affecting the
entire network and to provide resistance to the electromagnetic
interference (EMI) generated by machinery in the factory. The
design created by the other consultant calls for a Thin Ethernet
LAN with all of the computers connected to a single coaxial cable
segment. Which of the following statements about the proposal is
true?
A
. 
The solution achieves neither the primary goal nor either of the
secondary goals.
B
. 
The solution achieves the primary goal but neither of the
secondary goals.
C
. 
The solution achieves the primary goal and one of the
secondary goals.
D
. 
The solution achieves the primary goal and both of the
secondary goals.

Ed is a network consultant who has been contracted to design the
network for a new manufacturing plant. The plant consists of two
buildings 150 meters apart: an office containing 20 computers and
a manufacturing facility, which has 30 computers scattered
throughout it. The two most distant computers at the site are 225
meters apart. Ed’s design calls for a Gigabit Ethernet network
using fiber-optic cable. On receiving the proposal, the client
requests that Ed justify the additional labor and expense of
installing fiber-optic cable instead of unshielded twisted pair
(UTP). Which of the following is not a valid reason for choosing
fiber optic over UTP for this project?
A
. 
The 225 meter distance between the two most distant

computers exceeds Ethernet’s maximum cable segment length
for UTP.
B
. 
Only fiber-optic cable can keep the two buildings electrically
isolated.
C
. 
Fiber-optic cable is completely resistant to any electromagnetic
interference generated by the equipment in the manufacturing
plant.
D
. 
Fiber-optic cable provides a greater degree of tolerance to cable
breaks than UTP.

Alice is a network consultant who has been contracted to upgrade
an existing Ethernet network to Gigabit Ethernet. The network
consists of 20 workstations with integrated 10Base-T/100Base-
TX/1000Base-T network interface adapters. The network cabling is
Category 5 (CAT5) unshielded twisted pair (UTP), installed when
the building was constructed. All of the workstations are connected

to a single 100Base-T switch. Which of the following options would
Alice find to be a valid upgrade path to Gigabit Ethernet?
A
. 
Replace the CAT5 cable with Category 5e (CAT5e) or Category 6
(CAT6) and leave the existing network interface adapters and
switch in place.
B

Ralph is a network consultant with a client who wants him to
design the local area network (LAN) for his company’s new branch
office. The site consists of a building with unshielded twisted pair
(UTP) cable already installed, which the client considered a major
selling point when selecting the property. He wants Ralph to install
the fastest possible LAN using the existing cable. After examining
the site, Ralph notes that the cable is Category 5 (CAT5), installed
using a star topology, and that the individual cable runs are all less
than 100 meters long. Which of the following Ethernet physical
layer specifications can Ralph use for the new network to provide
the fastest transmission speeds without replacing the cable?
