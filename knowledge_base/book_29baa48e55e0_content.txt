Introduction
If you’re like most of us in the networking community, you probably have
one or more network certifications. If that’s you, you’re very wise in
choosing a CompTIA Network+ (N10-007) certification to proudly add to
your repertoire because that achievement will make you all the more valuable
as an employee. In these challenging economic times, keeping ahead of the
competition—even standing out among your present colleagues—could make
a big difference in whether you gain a promotion or possibly keep your job
instead of being the one who gets laid off! Or maybe this is your first attempt
at certification because you’ve decided to venture into a new career in
information technology (IT). You’ve realized that getting into the IT sector is
a good way to go because as the information age marches on, the demand for
knowledgeable professionals in this dynamic field will only intensify
dramatically.
Either way, certification is one of the best things you can do for your career if
you are working in, or want to break into, the networking profession because
it proves that you know what you’re talking about regarding the subjects in
which you’re certified. It also powerfully endorses you as a professional in a
way that’s very similar to a physician being board certified in a certain area
of expertise.
In this book, you’ll find out what the Network+ exam is all about because
each chapter covers a part of the exam. I’ve included some great review
questions at the end of each chapter to help crystallize the information you
learned and solidly prepare you to ace the exam.
A really cool thing about working in IT is that it’s constantly evolving, so
there are always new things to learn and fresh challenges to master. Once you
obtain your Network+ certification and discover that you’re interested in
taking it further by getting into more complex networking (and making more
money), the Cisco CCNA certification is definitely your next step; you can
get the skinny on that and even more in-depth certifications on my blog at
www.lammle.com
.
 

 
 
For Network+ training with Todd Lammle, both instructor-
led and online, please see  
www.lammle.com/network+
.
What Is the Network+ Certification?
Network+ is a certification developed by the Computing Technology Industry
Association (CompTIA) that exists to provide resources and education for the
computer and technology community. This is the same body that developed
the A+ exam for PC technicians.
The Network+ exam was designed to test the skills of network technicians
with 18 to 24 months of experience in the field. It tests areas of networking
technologies such as the definition of a protocol, the Open Systems
Interconnection (OSI) model and its layers, and the concepts of network
design and implementation—the minimum knowledge required for working
on a network and some integral prerequisites for network design and
implementation.
Why Become Network+ Certified?
Because CompTIA is a well-respected developer of vendor-neutral industry
certifications, becoming Network+ certified proves you’re competent in the
specific areas covered by the Network+ objectives.
Four major benefits are associated with becoming Network+ certified:
Proof of Professional Achievement
 Networking professionals are pretty
competitive when it comes to collecting more certifications than their peers.
And because the Network+ certification broadly covers the entire field of
networking, technicians want this certification a lot more than just Microsoft
certifications—Network+ is a lot more prestigious and valuable. Because it’s
rare to gain something that’s worth a lot with little effort, I’ll be honest—
preparing for the Network+ exam isn’t exactly a lazy day at the beach.
(However, beaches do happen to be really high on my personal list of great
places to study!) And people in IT know that it isn’t all that easy to pass the
Network+ exam, so they’ll definitely respect you more and know that you’ve
achieved a certain level of expertise about vendor-independent, networking-
related subjects.

Opportunity for Advancement
 We all like to get ahead in our careers—
advancement results in more responsibility and prestige, and it usually means
a fatter paycheck, greater opportunities, and added options. In the IT sector, a
great way to make sure all that good stuff happens is by earning a lot of
technology certifications, including Network+.
Fulfillment of Training Requirements
 Network+, because of its wide-
reaching industry support, is recognized as a baseline of networking
information. Some companies actually specify the possession of a Network+
certification as a job requirement before they’ll even consider hiring you, or it
may be specified as a goal to be met before your next review.
Customer Confidence
 As companies discover the CompTIA advantage, they
will undoubtedly require qualified staff to achieve these certifications. Many
companies outsource their work to consulting firms with experience working
with security. Firms that have certified staff have a definite advantage over
firms that don’t.
How to Become Network+ Certified
As this book goes to press, Pearson VUE is the sole Network+ exam
provider. The following is the necessary contact information and exam-
specific details for registering. Exam pricing might vary by country or by
CompTIA membership.

When you schedule the exam, you’ll receive instructions regarding
appointment and cancellation procedures, ID requirements, and information
about the testing center location. In addition, you’ll receive a registration and
payment confirmation letter. Exams can be scheduled up to six weeks out or
as soon as the next day (or, in some cases, even the same day).
 
 
 
 Exam prices and codes may vary based on the country in
which the exam is administered. For detailed pricing and

exam registration procedures, refer to CompTIA’s website at
www.comptia.org
.
After you’ve successfully passed your Network+ exam, CompTIA will award
you a certification. Within four to six weeks of passing the exam, you’ll
receive your official CompTIA Network+ certificate and ID card. (If you
don’t receive these within eight weeks of taking the test, contact CompTIA
directly using the information found in your registration packet.)
Tips for Taking the Network+ Exam
Here are some general tips for taking your exam successfully:
 
Bring two forms of ID with you. One must be a photo ID, such as a
driver’s license. The other can be a major credit card or a passport. Both
forms must include a signature.
Arrive early at the exam center so you can relax and review your study
materials, particularly tables and lists of exam-related information. After
you are ready to enter the testing room, you will need to leave
everything outside; you won’t be able to bring any materials into the
testing area.
Read the questions carefully. Don’t be tempted to jump to an early
conclusion. Make sure you know exactly what each question is asking.
Don’t leave any unanswered questions. Unanswered questions are
scored against you. There will be questions with multiple correct
responses. When there is more than one correct answer, a message at the
bottom of the screen will prompt you to either “choose two” or “choose
all that apply.” Be sure to read the messages displayed to know how
many correct answers you must choose.
When answering multiple-choice questions you’re not sure about, use a
process of elimination to get rid of the obviously incorrect answers first.
Doing so will improve your odds if you need to make an educated guess.
On form-based tests (nonadaptive), because the hard questions will take
the most time, save them for last. You can move forward and backward
through the exam.

Who Should Read This Book?
You—if want to pass the Network+ exam, and pass it confidently! This book
is chock-full of the exact information you need and directly maps to
Network+ exam objectives, so if you use it to study for the exam, your odds
of passing shoot way up.
And in addition to including every bit of knowledge you need to learn to pass
the exam, I’ve included some really great tips and solid wisdom to equip you
even further to successfully work in the real IT world.
What Does This Book Cover?
This book covers everything you need to know to pass the CompTIA
Network+ exam. But in addition to studying the book, it’s a good idea to
practice on an actual network if you can.
Here’s a list of the 20 chapters in this book:
Chapter 1, “Introduction to Networks”
 This chapter includes an
introduction to what a network is and an overview of the most common
physical network topologies you’ll find in today’s networks.
Chapter 2, “The Open Systems Interconnection Specifications”
 This
chapter covers the OSI model, what it is, what happens at each of its layers,
and how each layer works.
Chapter 3, “Networking Topologies, Connectors, and Wiring Standards”
This chapter covers the various networking media and topologies, plus the
cable types and properties used in today’s networks.
Chapter 4, “The Current Ethernet Specifications”
 This chapter covers
how a basic Ethernet LAN works and describes and categorizes the different
Ethernet specifications.
Chapter 5, “Networking Devices”
 It’s important for you to understand all
the various devices used in today’s networks, and this chapter will describe
how hubs, routers, and switches and some other devices work within a
network.
Chapter 6, “Introduction to the Internet Protocol”
 This is your
introduction to the all-important IP protocol stack.
Chapter 7, “IP Addressing”
 This chapter will take up from where Chapter 6

left off and move into IP addressing. It also contains information about public
versus private addressing and DHCP.
Chapter 8, “IP Subnetting, Troubleshooting IP, and Introduction to
NAT”
 Beginning where Chapter 7 ends, we’ll be tackling IP subnetting in
this one. But no worries here—I’ve worked hard to make this not-so-popular-
yet-vital topic as painless as possible.
Chapter 9, “Introduction to IP Routing”
 This is an introduction to routing
that basically covers what routers do and how they do it. This chapter, along
with Chapter 10 and Chapter 11, cover routing and switching in much more
detail than what is necessary to meet the CompTIA Network+ objectives
because this knowledge is so critical to grasp when working with today’s
networks.
Chapter 10, “Routing Protocols”
 This chapter goes into detail describing
the protocols that run on routers and that update routing tables to create a
working map of the network.
Chapter 11, “Switching and Virtual LANs”
 This chapter covers Layer 2
switching, the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), and virtual LANs. I went
deeper than needed for the exam with the routing chapters, and I’ll cover
switching and virtual LANs (which are also vital in today’s corporate
networks) more thoroughly as well.
Chapter 12, “Wireless Networking”
 Because wireless is so important for
both home and business networks today, this chapter is loaded with all the
information you need to be successful at wireless networking at home and
work.
Chapter 13, “Authentication and Access Control”
 This is the first of three
security chapters. There are tons of exam objectives about network security
that are so important that I took three chapters to cover all of them. In this
chapter, I’ll introduce security, security filtering, tunneling, and user
authentication.
Chapter 14, “Network Threats and Mitigation”
 This is probably the most
fun of the three security chapters because I’ll tell you all about security
threats and how to stop them. The only way to get good at network security is
to implement it, and this chapter shows you how.
Chapter 15, “Physical Security and Risk”
 This chapter’s focus is on

explaining basic firewalls, security devices, and device security.
Chapter 16, “Wide Area Networks”
 In this chapter, you get to learn all
about things like Frame Relay, E1/T1, DSL, cable modems, and more. All of
the CompTIA Network+ WAN objectives are covered in this chapter.
Chapter 17, “Troubleshooting Tools”
 This is also a fun chapter because,
again, you can follow along and run all the commands yourself. And I repeat,
it’s a really good idea to run through all the commands in this chapter!
Chapter 18, “Software and Hardware Tools”
 This chapter introduces you
to the network tools you will use to help you run your networks. Both
software and hardware tools will be discussed.
Chapter 19, “Network Troubleshooting”
 In almost every chapter, I discuss
how to verify and fix problems, but this chapter will really get into the nuts
and bolts of detailed network troubleshooting and documentation.
Chapter 20, “Management, Monitoring, and Optimization”
 This last
chapter will provide configuration-management documentation and covers
wiring, logical diagrams, baselines, policies, and regulations.
What’s Included in the Book
I’ve included several study tools throughout the book:
Assessment Test
 At the end of this introduction is an assessment test that
you can use to check your readiness for the exam. Take this test before you
start reading the book; it will help you determine the areas you might need to
brush up on. The answers to the assessment test questions appear on a
separate page after the last question of the test. Each answer includes an
explanation and a note telling you the chapter in which the material appears.
Objective Map and Opening List of Objectives
 On the inside front cover
of this book is a detailed exam objective map showing you where each of the
exam objectives is covered in this book. In addition, each chapter opens with
a list of the exam objectives it covers. Use these to see exactly where each of
the exam topics is covered.
Exam Essentials
 Each chapter, just after the summary, includes a number of
exam essentials. These are the key topics you should take from the chapter in
terms of areas to focus on when preparing for the exam.

Written Lab
 Each chapter includes a written lab. These are short exercises
that map to the exam objectives. Answers to these can be found in Appendix
A.
Chapter Review Questions
 To test your knowledge as you progress through
the book, there are review questions at the end of each chapter. As you finish
each chapter, answer the review questions and then check your answers—the
correct answers and explanations are in Appendix B. You can go back to
reread the section that deals with each question you got wrong to ensure that
you answer correctly the next time you’re tested on the material.
Interactive Online Learning Environment and Test
Bank
The interactive online learning environment that accompanies 
CompTIA
Network+ Study Guide: Exam N10-007
 provides a test bank with study tools
to help you prepare for the certification exam—and increase your chances of
passing it the first time! The test bank includes the following tools:
Sample Tests
 All of the questions in this book are provided, including the
assessment test, which you’ll find at the end of this introduction, and the
chapter tests that include the review questions at the end of each chapter. In
addition, there are two practice exams. Use these questions to test your
knowledge of the study guide material. The online test bank runs on multiple
devices.
Flashcards
 Approximately 100 questions are provided in digital flashcard
format (a question followed by a single correct answer). You can use the
flashcards to reinforce your learning and provide last-minute test prep before
the exam.
Other Study Tools
 A glossary of key terms from this book and their
definitions are available as a fully searchable PDF.

How to Use This Book
If you want a solid foundation for the serious effort of preparing for the
Network+ exam, then look no further because I’ve spent countless hours
putting together this book with the sole intention of helping you pass it!
This book is loaded with valuable information, and you will get the most out
of your study time if you understand how I put the book together. Here’s a
list that describes how to approach studying:
 
1
. 
Take the assessment test immediately following this introduction. (The
answers are at the end of the test, but no peeking!) It’s okay if you don’t
know any of the answers—that’s what this book is for. Carefully read
over the explanations for any question you get wrong, and make note of
the chapters where that material is covered.
2
. 
Study each chapter carefully, making sure you fully understand the
information and the exam objectives listed at the beginning of each one.
Again, pay extra-close attention to any chapter that includes material
covered in questions you missed on the assessment test.
3
. 
Complete the written lab at the end of each chapter. Do 
not
 skip these
written exercises because they directly map to the CompTIA objectives
and what you’ve got to have nailed down to meet them.
4
. 
Answer all the review questions related to each chapter. Specifically
note any questions that confuse you, and study the corresponding
sections of the book again. And don’t just skim these questions—make
sure you understand each answer completely.
5
. 
Try your hand at the practice exams. Before you take your test, be sure
to visit my website for questions, videos, audios, and other useful
information.
6
. 
Test yourself using all the electronic flashcards. This is a brand-new and
updated flashcard program to help you prepare for the latest CompTIA
Network+ exam, and it is a really great study tool.
I tell you no lies—learning every bit of the material in this book is going to
require applying yourself with a good measure of discipline. So try to set
aside the same time period every day to study, and select a comfortable and

quiet place to do so. If you work hard, you will be surprised at how quickly
you learn this material.
If you follow the steps listed here and study with the review questions,
practice exams, electronic flashcards, and all the written labs, you would
almost have to try to fail the CompTIA Network+ exam. However, studying
for the Network+ exam is like training for a marathon—if you don’t go for a
good run every day, you’re not likely to finish very well.

Exam Objectives
Speaking of objectives, you’re probably pretty curious about those, right?
CompTIA asked groups of IT professionals to fill out a survey rating the
skills they felt were important in their jobs, and the results were grouped into
objectives for the exam and divided into five domains.
This table gives you the extent by percentage that each domain is represented
on the actual examination.

Following the regulations

Answers to Assessment Test
 
1
. 
B. LANs generally have a geographic scope of a single
building or smaller. They can be simple (two hosts) to
complex (with thousands of hosts). See Chapter 1 for more
information.
2
. 
B. Star topologies are the easiest to troubleshoot and can
easily scale to large sizes. See Chapter 1 for more information.
3
. 
C. IP is a Network layer protocol. Internet Explorer is an
example of an Application layer protocol, Ethernet is an
example of a Data Link layer protocol, and T1 can be
considered a Physical layer protocol. See Chapter 2 for more
information.
4
. 
D. Layer 2 of the OSI model is the Data Link layer, which
provides the physical transmission of the data and handles
error notification, network topology, and flow control. See
Chapter 2 for more information.
5
. 
C. Cable modems use RG-6 coax cables. See Chapter 3 for
more information.
6
. 
D. To get the high data-transfer speed, like 1 Gbps, you need
to use a wire standard that is highly rated, such as Category 5e
or Category 6. See Chapter 3 for more information.
7
. 
A, B, C. With half duplex, you are using one wire pair with a
digital signal either transmitting or receiving (but not both at
once). Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection
(CSMA/CD) helps packets that are transmitted simultaneously
from different hosts share bandwidth evenly. See Chapter 4
for more information.
8
. 
B. To connect two switches together or a hub to a switch, you
need a crossover cable. See Chapter 4 for more information.
9
. 
A. For the most part, switches are not cheap; however, one of
the biggest benefits of using switches instead of hubs in your

internetwork is that each switch port is actually its own
collision domain. A hub creates one large collision domain.
Switches still can’t break up broadcast domains (do you know
which devices do?). Hubs do not recognize frames and data
structures but switches do. See Chapter 5 for more
information.
10
. 
C. A switch creates separate collision domains for each port
but does not break up broadcast domains by default. See
Chapter 5 for more information.
11
. 
D. DNS uses TCP for zone exchanges between servers and
UDP when a client is trying to resolve a hostname to an IP
address. See Chapter 6 for more information.
12
. 
A. HTTP, FTP, and Telnet use TCP at the Transport layer;
however, they are all Application layer protocols, so the
Application layer is the best answer for this question. See
Chapter 6 for more information.
13
. 
C. Anycast is a new type of communication that replaces
broadcasts in IPv4. Anycast addresses identify multiple
interfaces, which is the same as multicast; however, the big
difference is that the anycast packet is delivered to only one
address: the first one it finds defined in terms of routing
distance. This address can also be called one-to-one-of-many.
See Chapter 7 for more information.
14
. 
B, D. The addresses in the ranges 10.0.0.0 through
10.255.255.255 and 172.16.0.0 through 172.31.255.255 as
well as 192.168.0.0 through 192.168.255.255 are all
considered private, based on RFC 1918. Use of these
addresses on the Internet is prohibited so that they can be used
simultaneously in different administrative domains without
concern for conflict. See Chapter 7 for more detail on IP
addressing and information on private IP addresses.
15
. 
C. This is a pretty simple question. A /28 is 255.255.255.240,
which means that our block size is 16 in the fourth octet. 0, 16,
32, 48, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 144, 160, 176, and so on. The
host is in the subnet 160. See Chapter 8 for more information.

16
. 
B. To test the local stack on your host, ping the loopback
interface of 127.0.0.1. See Chapter 8 for more information.
17
. 
C. The Data Link layer is responsible for encapsulating IP
packets into frames and for providing logical network
addresses. See Chapter 9 for more information.
18
. 
A. Packets specifically have to be carried to a router in order
to be routed through a network. On your local computer, the
IP address of this router is displayed as the gateway address.
See Chapter 9 for more information.
19
. 
A, D. RIP and RIPv2 are distance vector routing protocols.
OSPF and IS-IS are link state. See Chapter 10 for more
information.
20
. 
D. EIGRP is called a hybrid routing protocol because it uses
the characteristics of both distance vector and link state
routing protocols. However, EIGRP can only be run on Cisco
routers and is not vendor neutral. The new CompTIA
objectives mention BGP as a hybrid routing protocol. See
Chapter 10 for more information.
21
. 
C. Virtual LANs break up broadcast domains in Layer 2
switched internetworks. See Chapter 11 for more information.
22

You’d have to work pretty hard these days to find someone who would argue
when we say that our computers have become invaluable to us personally and
professionally. Our society has become highly dependent on the resources
they offer and on sharing them with each other. The ability to communicate
with others—whether they’re in the same building or in some faraway land—
completely hinges on our capacity to create and maintain solid, dependable
networks.
And those vitally important networks come in all shapes and sizes—ranging
from small and simple to humongous and super complicated. But whatever
their flavor, they all need to be maintained properly, and to do that well, you
have to understand networking basics. The various types of devices and
technologies that are used to create networks, as well as how they work
together, is what this book is about, and I’ll go through this critical
information one step at a time with you. Understanding all of this will not
only equip you with a rock-solid base to build on as you gain IT knowledge
and grow in your career, it will also arm you with what you’ll need to ace the
Network+ certification exam!

First Things First: What’s a Network?
The dictionary defines the word 
network
 as “a group or system of
interconnected people or things.” Similarly, in the computer world, the term
network
 means two or more connected computers that can share resources
such as data and applications, office machines, an Internet connection, or
some combination of these, as shown in 
Figure 1.1
.
Figure 1.1
 A basic network
Figure 1.1
 shows a really basic network made up of only two host computers
connected; they share resources such as files and even a printer hooked up to
one of the hosts. These two hosts “talk” to each other using a computer
language called 
binary code
, which consists of lots of 1s and 0s in a specific
order that describes exactly what they want to “say.”
Next, I’m going to tell you about local area networks, how they work, and
even how we can connect LANs together. Then, later in this chapter, I’ll
describe how to connect remote LANs together through something known as
a wide area network.
The Local Area Network
Just as the name implies, a 
local area network (LAN)
 is usually restricted to
spanning a particular geographic location such as an office building, a single
department within a corporate office, or even a home office.
Back in the day, you couldn’t put more than 30 workstations on a LAN, and
you had to cope with strict limitations on how far those machines could

actually be from each other. Because of technological advances, all that’s
changed now, and we’re not nearly as restricted in regard to both a LAN’s
size and the distance a LAN can span. Even so, it’s still best to split a big
LAN into smaller logical zones known as 
workgroups
 to make administration
easier.
 
 
 
The meaning of the term  
workgroup
 in this context is
slightly different than when the term is used in contrast to
domains. In that context, a workgroup is a set of devices
with no security association with one another (whereas in a
domain they do have that association). In this context, we
simply mean they physically are in the same network
segment.
In a typical business environment, it’s a good idea to arrange your LAN’s
workgroups along department divisions; for instance, you would create a
workgroup for Accounting, another one for Sales, and maybe another for
Marketing—you get the idea. 
Figure 1.2
 shows two separate LANs, each as
its own workgroup.
Figure 1.2
 Two separate LANs (workgroups)

First, don’t stress about the devices labeled 
hub
 and 
switch
—these are just
connectivity devices that allow hosts to physically connect to resources on an
LAN. Trust me; I’ll describe them to you in much more detail in Chapter 5,
“Networking Devices.”
Anyway, back to the figure. Notice that there’s a Marketing workgroup and a
Sales workgroup. These are LANs in their most basic form. Any device that
connects to the Marketing LAN can access the resources of the Marketing
LAN—in this case, the servers and printer.
There are two problems with this:
 
You must be physically connected to a workgroup’s LAN to get the
resources from it.
You can’t get from one LAN to the other LAN and use its server data
and printing resources remotely.
This is a typical network issue that’s easily resolved by using a cool device
called a 
router
 to connect the two LANs, as shown in 
Figure 1.3
.
Figure 1.3
 A router connects LANs.

Nice—problem solved! Even though you can use routers for more than just
connecting LANs, the router shown in 
Figure 1.3
 is a great solution because
the host computers from the Sales LAN can get to the resources (server data
and printers) of the Marketing LAN, and vice versa.
Now, you might be thinking that we really don’t need the router—that we
could just physically connect the two workgroups with a type of cable that
would allow the Marketing and Sales workgroups to hook up somehow.
Well, we could do that, but if we did, we would have only one big,
cumbersome workgroup instead of separate workgroups for Marketing and
Sales, and that kind of arrangement just isn’t practical for today’s networks.
This is because with smaller, individual-yet-connected groups, the users on
each LAN enjoy much faster response times when accessing resources, and
administrative tasks are a lot easier, too. Larger workgroups run more slowly
because there’s a legion of hosts within them that are all trying to get to the
same resources simultaneously. So the router shown in 
Figure 1.3
, which
separates the workgroups while still allowing access between them, is a really
great solution!
 
 Don’t focus too much on the network connectivity devices

 
 
like the hubs, routers, and switches I’ve mentioned so far in
this chapter yet. We’ll thoroughly cover them all later, in
Chapter 5. Right now, I really want you to prioritize your
understanding of the concepts that I’m presenting here, so at
this point, all you need to know is that hubs and switches are
devices that connect other devices together into a network
and routers connect networks together.
So let me define the other terms I’ve used so far: 
workstations
, 
servers
, and
hosts
.
Common Network Components
There are a lot of different machines, devices, and media that make up our
networks. Let’s talk about three of the most common:
 
Workstations
Servers
Hosts
Workstations
Workstations
 are often seriously powerful computers that run more than one
central processing unit (CPU) and whose resources are available to other
users on the network to access when needed. With this much power, you
might think I am describing a server—not quite because there is an important
difference between these devices that I’ll cover in the next section.
Workstations are often employed as systems that end users use on a daily
basis. Don’t confuse workstations with client machines, which can be
workstations but not always. People often use the terms 
workstation
 and
client
 interchangeably. In colloquial terms, this isn’t a big deal; we all do it.
But technically speaking, they are different. A 
client machine
 is any device
on the network that can ask for access to resources like a printer or other
hosts from a server or powerful workstation.
 
 
 
The terms  
workstation
, 
client
, and 
host
 can sometimes be

used interchangeably. Computers have become more and
more powerful and the terms have become somewhat fuzzy
because hosts can be clients, workstations, servers, and
more! The term 
host
 is used to describe pretty much
anything that takes an IP address.
Servers
Servers
 are also powerful computers. They get their name because they truly
are “at the service” of the network and run specialized software known as the
network operating system to maintain and control the network.
In a good design that optimizes the network’s performance, servers are highly
specialized and are there to handle one important labor-intensive job. This is
not to say that a single server can’t do many jobs, but more often than not,
you’ll get better performance if you dedicate a server to a single task. Here’s
a list of common dedicated servers:
File Server
 Stores and dispenses files
Mail Server
 The network’s post office; handles email functions
Print Server
 Manages printers on the network
Web Server
 Manages web-based activities by running Hypertext Transfer
Protocol (HTTP) for storing web content and accessing web pages
Fax Server
 The “memo maker” that sends and receives paperless faxes over
the network
Application Server
 Manages network applications
Telephony Server
 Handles the call center and call routing and can be
thought of as a sophisticated network answering machine
Proxy Server
 Handles tasks in the place of other machines on the network,
particularly an Internet connection.
 
 
 
See how the name of each kind of server indicates what it
actually does—how it serves the network? This is an
excellent way to remember them. 

As I said, servers are usually dedicated to doing one specific important thing
within the network. Not always, though—sometimes they have more than
one job. But whether servers are designated for one job or are network
multitaskers, they can maintain the network’s data integrity by backing up the
network’s software and providing redundant hardware (for fault tolerance).
And no matter what, they all serve a number of client machines.
Back in 
Figure 1.2
, I showed you an example of two really simple LAN
networks. I want to make sure you know that servers must have considerably
superior CPUs, hard-drive space, and memory—a lot more than a simple
client’s capacity—because they serve many client machines and provide any
resources they require. Because they’re so important, you should always put
your servers in a very secure area. My company’s servers are in a locked
server room because not only are they really pricey workhorses, they also
store huge amounts of important and sensitive company data, so they need to
be kept safe from any unauthorized access.
In 
Figure 1.4
, you can see a network populated with both workstations and
servers. Also notice that the hosts can access the servers across the network,
which is pretty much the general idea of having a network in the first place!
You probably picked up on the fact that there are more workstations here
than servers, right? Think of why that is. If you answered that it’s because
one server can provide resources to what can sometimes be a huge number of
individual users at the same time but workstations don’t, you nailed it!
Figure 1.4
 A network populated with servers and workstations

Hosts
This can be kind of confusing because when people refer to hosts, they really
can be referring to almost any type of networking devices—including
workstations and servers. But if you dig a bit deeper, you’ll find that usually
this term comes up when people are talking about resources and jobs that
have to do with Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP).
The scope of possible machines and devices is so broad because, in TCP/IP-
speak, 
host
 means any network device with an IP address. Yes, you’ll hear IT
professionals throw this term around pretty loosely; for the Network+ exam,
stick to the definition being network devices, including workstations and
servers, with IP addresses.
Here’s a bit of background: The name 
host
 harks back to the Jurassic period
of networking when those dinosaurs known as 
mainframes
 were the only

intelligent devices able to roam the network. These were called 
hosts
 whether
they had TCP/IP functionality or not. In that bygone age, everything else in
the network-scape was referred to as 
dumb terminals
 because only
mainframes—hosts—were given IP addresses. Another fossilized term from
way back then is 
gateways
, which was used to talk about any Layer 3
machines like routers. We still use these terms today, but they’ve evolved a
bit to refer to the many intelligent devices populating our present-day
networks, each of which has an IP address. This is exactly the reason you
hear 
host
 used so broadly.
Wide Area Network
There are legions of people who, if asked to define a 
wide area network
(WAN)
, just couldn’t do it. Yet most of them use the big dog of all WANs—
the Internet—every day! With that in mind, you can imagine that WAN
networks are what we use to span large geographic areas and truly go the
distance. Like the Internet, WANs usually employ both routers and public
links, so that’s generally the criteria used to define them.
 
 
 
WANs are so important that I have dedicated an entire
chapter to them: Chapter 16, “Wide Area Networks.” 
Here’s a list of some of the important ways that WANs are different from
LANs:
 
WANs usually need a router port or ports.
WANs span larger geographic areas and/or can link disparate locations.
WANs are usually slower.
We can choose when and how long we connect to a WAN. A LAN is all
or nothing—our workstation is connected to it either permanently or not
at all, although most of us have dedicated WAN links now.
WANs can utilize either private or public data transport media such as
phone lines.

We get the word 
Internet
 from the term 
internetwork
. An internetwork is a
type of LAN and/or WAN that connects a bunch of networks, or 
intranets
. In
an internetwork, hosts still use hardware addresses to communicate with
other hosts on the LAN. However, they use logical addresses (IP addresses)
to communicate with hosts on a different LAN (other side of the router).
And 
routers
 are the devices that make this possible. Each connection into a
router is a different logical network. 
Figure 1.5
 demonstrates how routers are
employed to create an internetwork and how they enable our LANs to access
WAN resources.
Figure 1.5
 An internetwork
The Internet is a prime example of what’s known as a 
distributed WAN
—an
internetwork that’s made up of a lot of interconnected computers located in a

lot of different places. There’s another kind of WAN, referred to as
centralized
, that’s composed of a main, centrally located computer or location
that remote computers and devices can connect to. A good example is remote
offices that connect to a main corporate office, as shown in 
Figure 1.5
.
MPLS
Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) will be defined clearly in Chapter 16,
but for the objectives of the CompTIA Network+ exam, this chapter will
define the actual layout of what is one of the most popular WAN protocols in
use today. MPLS has become one of the most innovative and flexible
networking technologies on the market, and it has some key advantages over
other WAN technologies:
 
Physical layout flexibility
Prioritizing of data
Redundancy in case of link failure
One-to-many connection
MPLS is a switching mechanism that imposes labels (numbers) to data and
then uses those labels to forward data when it arrives at the MPLS network,
as shown in 
Figure 1.6
.
Figure 1.6
 Multiprotocol Label Switching layout

The labels are assigned on the edge of the MPLS network, and forwarding
inside the MPLS network (cloud) is done solely based on labels through
virtual links instead of physical links. Prioritizing data is a huge advantage;
for example, voice data could have priority over basic data based on the
labels. And since there are multiple paths for the data to be forwarded
through the MPLS cloud, there’s even some redundancy provided as well.
Network Architecture: Peer-to-Peer or Client-Server?
We’ve developed networking as a way to share resources and information,
and how that’s achieved directly maps to the particular architecture of the
network operating system software. There are two main network types you
need to know about: peer-to-peer and client-server. And by the way, it’s
really tough to tell the difference just by looking at a diagram or even by
checking out live video of the network humming along. But the differences
between peer-to-peer and client-server architectures are pretty major. They’re
not just physical; they’re logical differences. You’ll see what I mean in a bit.
Peer-to-Peer Networks
Computers connected together in 
peer-to-peer networks
 do not have any
central, or special, authority—they’re all 
peers
, meaning that when it comes
to authority, they’re all equals. The authority to perform a security check for

proper access rights lies with the computer that has the desired resource being
requested from it.
It also means that the computers coexisting in a peer-to-peer network can be
client machines that access resources and server machines and provide those
resources to other computers. This actually works pretty well as long as there
isn’t a huge number of users on the network, if each user backs things up
locally, and if your network doesn’t require much security.
If your network is running Windows, Mac, or Unix in a local LAN
workgroup, you have a peer-to-peer network. 
Figure 1.7
 gives you a snapshot
of a typical peer-to-peer network. Keep in mind that peer-to-peer networks
definitely present security-oriented challenges; for instance, just backing up
company data can get pretty sketchy!
Figure 1.7
 A peer-to-peer network
Since it should be clear by now that peer-to-peer networks aren’t all sunshine,
backing up all your critical data may be tough, but it’s vital! Haven’t all of us
forgotten where we’ve put an important file? And then there’s that glaring
security issue to tangle with. Because security is not centrally governed, each
and every user has to remember and maintain a list of users and passwords on
each and every machine. Worse, some of those all-important passwords for
the same users change on different machines—even for accessing different
resources. What a mess!

Client-Server Networks
Client-server networks
 are pretty much the polar opposite of peer-to-peer
networks because in them, a single server uses a network operating system
for managing the whole network. Here’s how it works: A client machine’s
request for a resource goes to the main server, which responds by handling
security and directing the client to the desired resource. This happens instead
of the request going directly to the machine with the desired resource, and it
has some serious advantages. First, because the network is much better
organized and doesn’t depend on users remembering where needed resources
are, it’s a whole lot easier to find the files you need because everything is
stored in one spot—on that special server. Your security also gets a lot tighter
because all usernames and passwords are on that specific server, which is
never ever used as a workstation. You even gain scalability—client-server
networks can have legions of workstations on them. And surprisingly, with
all those demands, the network’s performance is actually optimized—nice!
Check out 
Figure 1.8
, which shows a client-server network with a server that
has a database of access rights, user accounts, and passwords.
Figure 1.8
 A client-server network
Many of today’s networks are hopefully a healthy blend of peer-to-peer and
client-server architectures, with carefully specified servers that permit the
simultaneous sharing of resources from devices running workstation
operating systems. Even though the supporting machines can’t handle as
many inbound connections at a time, they still run the server service
reasonably well. And if this type of mixed environment is designed well,

most networks benefit greatly by having the capacity to take advantage of the
positive aspects of both worlds.

Physical Network Topologies
Just as a topographical map is a type of map that shows the shape of the
terrain, the 
physical topology 
of a network is also a type of map. It defines the
specific characteristics of a network, such as where all the workstations and
other devices are located and the precise arrangement of all the physical
media such as cables. On the other hand, the 
logical topologies
 we covered
earlier delineate exactly how data moves through the network. Now, even
though these two topologies are usually a lot alike, a particular network can
actually have physical and logical topologies that are very different.
Basically, what you want to remember is that a network’s physical topology
gives you the lay of the land and the logical topology shows how a digital
signal or data navigates through that layout.
Here’s a list of the topologies you’re most likely to run into these days:
 
Bus
Star
Ring
Mesh
Point-to-point
Point-to-multipoint
Hybrid
Bus Topology
This type of topology is the most basic one of the bunch, and it really does
sort of resemble a bus, but more like one that’s been in a wreck! Anyway, the
bus topology
 consists of two distinct and terminated ends, with each of its
computers connecting to one unbroken cable running its entire length. Back
in the day, we used to attach computers to that main cable with wire taps, but
this didn’t work all that well so we began using drop cables in their place. If
we were dealing with 10Base2 Ethernet, we would slip a “T” into the main
cable anywhere we wanted to connect a device to it instead of using drop
cables.

Figure 1.9
 depicts what a typical bus network’s physical topology looks like.
Figure 1.9
 A typical bus network’s physical topology
Even though all the computers on this kind of network see all the data
flowing through the cable, only the one computer, which the data is
specifically addressed to, actually 
gets
 the data. Some of the benefits of using
a bus topology are that it’s easy to install and it’s not very expensive, partly
because it doesn’t require as much cable as the other types of physical
topologies. But it also has some drawbacks: For instance, it’s hard to
troubleshoot, change, or move, and it really doesn’t offer much in the way of
fault tolerance because everything is connected to that single cable. This
means that any fault in the cable would basically bring the whole network
down!
