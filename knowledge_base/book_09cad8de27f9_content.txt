Introduction
CCNA Routing and Switching Practice Tests
 is a companion volume to the
CCNA Routing and Switching Complete Study Guide, Second Edition
. If
you’re looking to test your knowledge before you take the CCNA exam, this
book will help you by providing a combination of 1,500 questions that cover
the CCNA objectives.
If you’re just starting to prepare for the CCNA exam, I highly recommend that
you use the 
CCNA Routing and Switching Complete Study Guide, Second
Edition
 by Todd Lammle (Sybex, 2016) to help you learn about each of the
objectives covered in the CCNA exam. Once you’re ready to test your
knowledge, use this book to help find places where you may need to study
more or to practice for the exam itself.
Since it is a companion to the 
CCNA Routing and Switching Complete Study
Guide, Second Edition
, this book is designed to be similar to taking the CCNA
Routing and Switching exam. It contains scenarios and standard multiple-
choice questions similar to those you may encounter in the certification exam
itself. The book contains nine chapters: seven objective-centric chapters with
140 to 320 questions, weighted by the objectives, and two chapters that
contain 50-question practice tests to simulate taking the exam itself. The bulk
of the questions are in the routing and switching objectives.

Cisco’s Network Certification
It used to be that to secure the holy grail of Cisco certifications—the CCIE—
you passed only one written test before being faced with a grueling,
formidable hands-on lab. This intensely daunting, all-or-nothing approach
made it nearly impossible to succeed and predictably didn’t work out too well
for most people. Cisco responded to this issue by creating a series of new
certifications, which not only made it easier to eventually win the highly
coveted CCIE prize, it gave employers a way to accurately rate and measure
the skill levels of prospective and current employees. This exciting paradigm
shift in Cisco’s certification path truly opened doors that few were allowed
through before!
Beginning in 1998, obtaining the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)
certification was the first milestone in the Cisco certification climb, as well as
the official prerequisite to each of the more advanced levels. But that changed
in 2007 when Cisco announced the Cisco Certified Entry Network Technician
(CCENT) certification. And then in May 2016, Cisco once again proclaimed
updates to the CCENT and CCNA Routing and Switching (R/S) tests. Now the
Cisco certification process looks like Figure I.1.
Cisco Certified Entry Network Technician (CCENT)
Don’t be fooled by the oh-so-misleading name of this first certification
because it absolutely isn’t entry level! Okay—maybe entry level for Cisco’s
certification path, but definitely not for someone without experience trying to
break into the highly lucrative yet challenging IT job market! For the
uninitiated, the CompTIA A+ and Network+ certifications aren’t official
prerequisites, but know that Cisco does expect you to have that type and level
of experience before embarking on your Cisco certification journey.
All of this gets us to 2017, when the climb to Cisco supremacy got much
harder again. The innocuous-sounding siren’s call of the CCENT can lure you

to some serious trouble if you’re not prepared, because it’s actually much
harder than the old CCNA ever was. This will rapidly become apparent once
you start studying, but be encouraged! The fact that the certification process
is getting harder really works better for you in the long run, because that
which is harder to obtain only becomes that much more valuable when you
finally do, right? Yes, indeed!
Another important factor to keep in mind is that the Interconnection Cisco
Network Devices Part 1 (ICND1) exam, which is the required exam for the
CCENT certification, costs $150 per attempt, and it’s anything but easy to
pass! However, there is one way to skip the CCENT exam and still meet the
prerequisite before moving on to any other certification track, and that path is
through the CCNA R/S Composite exam. First, I’ll discuss the
Interconnecting Cisco Network Devices Part 2 (ICND2) exam, and then I’ll
tell you about the CCNA Composite exam, which will provide you, when
successful, with both the CCENT and the CCNA R/S certification.
Cisco Certified Network Associate Routing and Switching
(CCNA R/S)
Once you have achieved your CCENT certification, you can take the ICND2
(200-105) exam in order to achieve your CCNA R/S certification, which is the
most popular certification Cisco has by far because it’s the most sought-after
certification of all employers.
As with the CCENT, the ICND2 exam is also $150 per attempt—although
thinking you can just skim a book and pass any of these exams would
probably be a really expensive mistake! The CCENT/CCNA exams are
extremely hard and cover a lot of material, so you have to really know your
stuff. Taking a Cisco class or spending months with hands-on experience is
definitely a requirement to succeed when faced with this monster!
And once you have your CCNA, you don’t have to stop there—you can choose
to continue and achieve an even higher certification, called the Cisco Certified
Network Professional (CCNP). There are various ones, as shown in Figure 1.1.
The CCNP R/S is still the most popular, with Voice certifications coming in at
a close second. And I’ve got to tell you that the Data Center certification will
be catching up fast. Also good to know is that anyone with a CCNP R/S has all
the skills and knowledge needed to attempt the notoriously dreaded but
coveted CCIE R/S lab. But just becoming a CCNA R/S can land you 
that job

you’ve dreamed about, and that’s what this book is all about: helping you to
get and keep a great job!
Still, why take two exams to get your CCNA if you don’t have to? Cisco still
has the CCNA Routing and Switching Composite (200-125) exam that, if
passed, will land you with your CCENT and your CCNA R/S via only one test
priced at only $295. Some people like the one-test approach, and some people
like the two-test approach. Part of this book covers the ICND2 exam topics.
Why Become a CCENT and CCNA R/S?
Cisco, like Microsoft and other vendors that provide certification, has created
the certification process to give administrators a set of skills and to equip
prospective employers with a way to measure those skills or match certain
criteria. And as you probably know, becoming a CCNA R/S is certainly the
initial, key step on a successful journey toward a new, highly rewarding, and
sustainable networking career.
The CCNA program was created to provide a solid introduction not only to the
Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS) and Cisco hardware but also to
internetworking in general, making it helpful to you in areas that are not
exclusively Cisco’s. And regarding today’s certification process, it’s not
unrealistic that network managers—even those without Cisco equipment—
require Cisco certifications for their job applicants. Rest assured that if you
make it through the CCNA and are still interested in Cisco and
internetworking, you’re headed down a path to certain success!
What Skills Do You Need to Become a CCNA R/S?
This ICND1 exam (100-105) tests a candidate for the knowledge and skills
required to successfully install, operate, and troubleshoot a small branch
office network. The exam includes questions on the operation of IP data
networks, LAN switching technologies, IPv6, IP routing technologies, IP
services, network device security, and basic troubleshooting. The ICND2
exam (200-105) tests a candidate for the knowledge and skills required to
successfully install, operate, and troubleshoot a small- to medium-size
enterprise branch network. The exam includes questions on LAN switching
technologies, IP routing technologies, security, troubleshooting, and WAN
technologies.

How Do You Become a CCNA R/S
If you want to go straight for your CCNA R/S and take only one exam, all you
have to do is pass the CCNA Composite exam (200-125). Oh, but don’t you
wish it were that easy? True, it’s just one test, but it’s a whopper, and to pass
it you must possess enough knowledge to understand what the test writers
are saying, and you need to know everything I mentioned previously, in the
sections on the ICND1 and ICND2 exams! Hey, it’s hard, but it can be done!
What does the CCNA Composite exam (200-125) cover? Pretty much the
same topics covered in the ICND1 and ICND2 exams. Exam 200-125 tests a
candidate’s knowledge and skills required to install, operate, and troubleshoot
a small to medium-size enterprise branch network.
While you can take the Composite exam to get your CCNA, it’s good to know
that Cisco offers the two-step process I discussed earlier in this introduction.
And this book covers both those exams too! It may be easier than taking that
one ginormous exam for you, but don’t think the two-test method is easy. It
takes work! However, it can be done; you just need to stick with your studies.
The two-test method involves passing the following:
Exam 100-105: Interconnecting Cisco Networking Devices Part 1 (ICND1)
Exam 200-105: Interconnecting Cisco Networking Devices Part 2 (ICND2)

Where Do You Take the Exams?
You may take the ICND1, ICND2, or CCNA R/S Composite or any Cisco exam
at any of the Pearson VUE authorized testing centers. For information, check
www.vue.com
 or call 877-404-EXAM (3926).
To register for a Cisco exam, follow these steps:
1
. 
Determine the number of the exam you want to take. (The ICND1 exam
number is 100-105, ICND2 is 100-205, and CCNA R/S Composite is 200-
125.)
2
. 
Register with the nearest Pearson VUE testing center. At this point, you
will be asked to pay in advance for the exam. At the time of this writing,
the ICND1 and ICND2 exams are $150 each, and the CCNA R/S Composite
exam is $295. The exams must be taken within one year of payment. You
can schedule exams up to six weeks in advance or as late as the day you
want to take it—but if you fail a Cisco exam, you must wait five days
before you will be allowed to retake it. If something comes up and you
need to cancel or reschedule your exam appointment, contact Pearson
VUE at least 24 hours in advance.
3
. 
When you schedule the exam, you’ll get instructions regarding all
appointment and cancellation procedures, the ID requirements, and
information about the testing-center location.
Tips for Taking Your Cisco Exams
The Cisco exams contain about 40–50 questions and must be completed in
about 90 minutes or less. This information can change per exam. You must
get a score of about 85 percent to pass this exam, but again, each exam can be
different.
Many questions on the exam have answer choices that at first glance look
identical, especially the syntax questions! So remember to read through the
choices carefully because 
close just doesn’t cut it. If you get commands in the
wrong order or forget one measly character, you’ll get the question wrong. So,
to practice, do the hands-on exercises at the end of this book’s chapters over
and over again until they feel natural to you.
Also, never forget that the right answer is the Cisco answer. In many cases,
more than one appropriate answer is presented, but the correct answer is the

one that Cisco recommends. On the exam, you will always be told to pick one,
two, or three options, never “choose all that apply.” The Cisco exam may
include the following test formats:
Multiple-choice single answer
Multiple-choice multiple answers
Drag-and-drop
Router simulations
Cisco proctored exams will not show the steps to follow in completing a
router interface configuration, but they do allow partial command responses.
For example, 
show run
, 
sho running
, or 
sh running-config
 would be
acceptable.
Here are some general tips for exam success:
Arrive early at the exam center so you can relax and review your study
materials.
Read the questions carefully. Don’t jump to conclusions. Make sure you’re
clear about exactly what each question asks. “Read twice, answer once,” is
what I always tell my students.
When answering multiple-choice questions that you’re not sure about, use
the process of elimination to get rid of the obviously incorrect answers
first. Doing this greatly improves your odds if you need to make an
educated guess.
You can no longer move forward and backward through the Cisco exams,
so double-check your answer before clicking Next since you can’t change
your mind.
After you complete an exam, you’ll get immediate, online notification of your
pass or fail status, a printed examination score report that indicates your pass
or fail status, and your exam results by section. (The test administrator will
give you the printed score report.) Test scores are automatically forwarded to
Cisco within five working days after you take the test, so you don’t need to
send your score to them. If you pass the exam, you’ll receive confirmation
from Cisco, typically within two to four weeks, sometimes a bit longer.

Using This Book to Practice
This book is composed of nine chapters. Each of the first seven chapters
covers a domain, with a variety of questions that can help you test your
knowledge of real-world, scenario, and best practices–based networking
knowledge. The final two chapters are complete practice exams that can serve
as timed practice tests to help determine if you’re ready for the CCNA exam.
I recommend taking the first practice exam to help identify where you may
need to spend more study time, and then using the domain-specific chapters
to test your domain knowledge where it is weak. Once you’re ready, take the
second practice exam to make sure you’ve covered all of the material and are
ready to attempt the CCNA exam.
The book is separated into nine chapters, seven chapters to reflect the major
objectives and two chapters with practice tests:
Chapter 1: Network Fundamentals (Domain 1)
Chapter 2: LAN Switching Technologies (Domain 2)
Chapter 3: Routing Technologies (Domain 3)
Chapter 4: WAN Technologies (Domain 4)
Chapter 5: Infrastructure Services (Domain 5)
Chapter 6: Infrastructure Security (Domain 6)
Chapter 7: Infrastructure Management (Domain 7)
Chapter 8: Practice Test 1
Chapter 9: Practice Test 2
